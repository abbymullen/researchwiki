- Captured by [USS *John Adams*](), 13 May 1803. [Richard Valentine Morris]() writes to [James Simpson](): "last Evening the U. S. Frigate John Adam arrived at this place from her station off the Port of Tripoli and brought in with her the ship Messudar [Meshouda] claimed by the Emperor of Morrocco as his Property, and which notwithstanding your declaring in your Passport that Blockaded Ports were to be respected was taken [13 May 1803] in attempting to go into Tripoli with a considerable number of Guns Cutlashes Hem & other contraband articles that were not on Board when she left Gibralter, and not expressed in her Passports - She shall not be condemned if proved that this was not the orders of the Emperor - It is however expected that the Captain will be severely punished if it is an act of his own - There are also twenty Tripoline subjects on Board - in short this whole business appears to be a detestable Fraud" (BW2:408)
- Questions arose instantly about the legality of her capture
- Agent of the bashaw of Tripoli writes to the emperor of Morocco to tell him that the *Meshouda* was captured and has been taken to Malta for adjudication; the agent is concerned that a fair hearing be given: "We do not know if the said Commandant at sight of the Passport of your Majesty will proceed to Judge the Vessel or not, therefor we make this known to Your Majesty, whose knowledge is the highest" (BW2:434, 2 June 1803)
- BW2:456: After being informed that the *Meshouda* had been going to Tripoli in violation of the emperor's orders, but "Even after a long conversation he could not be made fully to believe that Omar could have committed such a mad Action, and so diametricaly opposite to the Instructions he had given him, by His Majestys Command" (20 June 1803, letter from [James Simpson]())
- BW2:456: Emperor disavows all knowledge or collusion with the captain of the *Meshouda* and even wants him returned to Morocco in irons
- BW2:456: [James Simpson]() urges that the cargo of the *Meshouda* be restored, in the spirit of honoring the agreement with the emperor, even though the *Meshouda* did not itself honor the agreement (20 June 1803)
- - BW2:275: Simpson and Campbell asked for voucher from the emperor of Morocco that the Tripolitan ship was actually his, and he gave it to them: " she carrys Our Victorious Flag, and goes on the fulfillment of Our Orders and intentions. - Let no one oppose her or hinder her, neither do her any Injury; and we Order all the Consuls to despatch her, and deliver their Passports." 
- BW2:337-38: After a passport was granted to the Meshouda, apparently its captain felt that the [USS *Adams*]() ([Hugh G. Campbell]()) was just waiting outside Gibraltar to capture it if it left; therefore, Meshouda stayed in Gibraltar and its captain filed a complaint with the Moroccan government (24 December 1802)
- BW2:470-71: [James Simpson]() outlines the benefits/detriments of [Richard Valentine Morris]()'s plan to let the Meshouda be condemned by an international court: "I am well aware that the circumstances of the Meshouda case would justify Commodore Morris going to every rigour with her, were the Ship under the Flag of any Power by whom the Law of Nations is observed, but I conclude he made a distinction when in his Letter to me he says, "she shall not be Condemned if proved that this was not the "Order of the Emperour. It is however expected that the "Captain will be severely punished if it is an Act of his own." It was upon this principle and not from any sense of Justice on their side that I expressed my hopes to the Commodore the Ship would be liberated: --her Condemnation I am fully persuaded would give the highest disgust to the Emperour, on the contrary its my oppinion her release would afford me, after what has happened, a happy opportunity of makeing a strong impression on his Majestys mind of the Friendly intentions of the Government of the United States towards him" (9 July 1803)
- BW2:513: [James Leander Cathcart]() writes to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that he feels the taking of the *Meshouda* as prize has caused "a rupture with Morocco & caused a division of our force at the moment when it could have been render'd the most serviciable" (15 August 1803)
- BW2:513: [James Leander Cathcart]() suggests that they use the *Meshouda* as a bargaining chip instead of cash with Tripoli; he therefore suggests that they make it look like the ship matters to the Americans: "If the above proposal meets your ideas it would be of advantage to order her to be painted & her yards & rigging black'd & tar'd, in order to make the Bashaw suppose we set some value on her - & increase his desire of repossessing her, by her appearing before his capital in this situation it would interest his pride & thus add the Force of another passion to that of his cupidity in our favor & it undoubtedly would be more honorable as well as advantageous to divide a sum of money among our own Citizens than to give it to the Bashaw of Tripoli provided it answer'd the same purposes" (15 August 1803) 
- BW3:8: [James Simpson]() writes to the emperor of Morocco: " The American Commodore instantly acquainted me of this event [the capture], saying at same time if this proved to be an Act of Raiz Omars unauthorised, the Ship should be liberated as a proof of the disposition of the American Government to gratify Your Majesty on every occasion, for had this Vessel been under any other Flag than that of your Majesty, she would perfectly consistent with the Law of Nations and invanable Custom in such cases, been instantly confiscated. I communicate all these circumstances to Alcayde Hashash who assured me Raiz Omar had acted contrary to the Orders he gave him in Your Majestys name, which I lost no time in writing to the American Commodore, but unfortunately the want of conveyance for Malta delayed that Letter a very long time at Gibraltar, insomuch that to this day I have not got the Commodores determination."
    - Simpson goes on to recount the taking of the [*Mirboka*](): "As my Passports were applied for and granted for the Mirboka and all the other Vessels of War sent, out from Your Majestys Ports this Summer, I could not but be very much surprised to find they were authorised to capture American Vessels, as I never had received the least information that Your Majesty had seen any cause to disturb that harmony which so happily bad been restored and continued to subsist, between Your Majesty and the United States of America. - Under the mentioned circumstances it became the indispensible duty of the American Captain to retake the Brig of his Nation, and also to detain the Mirboka as she had been sent to Sea for the purpose of making War against America" (BW3:8)
- 3 September 1803: [James Simpson]() reports that some of the crew of the *Meshouda* had returned to Morocco alleging ill treatment at the hands of [John Rodgers](); he is certain the allegations are false, "but at that moment it suited the Governour's purpose extremely, as well as at the conferrence with the Consuls in the fore noon, and I am persuaded he has painted the whole as facts, and in very lively colours to the Emperor"; therefore Simpson requests that the crew be debriefed with other people as well, hopefully to get them to recant (BW3:10) 
    - 19 September 1803: [James Simpson]() reports that the Moorish captains have issued statements clearing the Americans of wrongful treatment, which Simpson hopes will quash the rumors that Alcayde Hashash is spreading
- 13 September 1803: [Edward Preble]() learns of the whole situation when he arrives in the Mediterranean. His take: that it's clear the *Meshouda* was headed for Tripoli to provide them with naval stores, etc. "Commodore Morris has the Controul of that business, and must act as he pleases, but if she came within my command, I should most certainly send her to the United States. The Captains and Officers of the Emperor, dare not act without his [the Emperor's, I think] Orders" (BW3:31)
- 24 September 1803: [Edward Preble]() orders [Richard Somers]() in the [USS *Nautilus*]() to "Anchor the Nautilus very close to the prize Ship Messuada to protect her, as she has a great number of prisioners on board, and it is to be apprehended they may if opportunity offers endeavor to rise upon our Men, and run the Ship on shore" (BW3:74)
- BW3:145: log of the [USS *Constitution*]() notes that the *Meshouda* is being delivered back to the emperor, but that she is going to Sallee to be hauled up and never sailed again (17 October 1803)
