- Captured by [USS *John Adams*](), 13 May 1803. [Richard Valentine Morris]() writes to [James Simpson](): "last Evening the U. S. Frigate John Adam arrived at this place from her station off the Port of Tripoli and brought in with her the ship Messudar [Meshouda] claimed by the Emperor of Morrocco as his Property, and which notwithstanding your declaring in your Passport that Blockaded Ports were to be respected was taken [13 May 1803] in attempting to go into Tripoli with a considerable number of Guns Cutlashes Hem & other contraband articles that were not on Board when she left Gibralter, and not expressed in her Passports - She shall not be condemned if proved that this was not the orders of the Emperor - It is however expected that the Captain will be severely punished if it is an act of his own - There are also twenty Tripoline subjects on Board - in short this whole business appears to be a detestable Fraud" (BW2:408)
- Questions arose instantly about the legality of her capture
- Agent of the bashaw of Tripoli writes to the emperor of Morocco to tell him that the *Meshouda* was captured and has been taken to Malta for adjudication; the agent is concerned that a fair hearing be given: "We do not know if the said Commandant at sight of the Passport of your Majesty will proceed to Judge the Vessel or not, therefor we make this known to Your Majesty, whose knowledge is the highest" (BW2:434, 2 June 1803)
- BW2:456: After being informed that the *Meshouda* had been going to Tripoli in violation of the emperor's orders, but "Even after a long conversation he could not be made fully to believe that Omar could have committed such a mad Action, and so diametricaly opposite to the Instructions he had given him, by His Majestys Command" (20 June 1803, letter from [James Simpson]())
- BW2:456: Emperor disavows all knowledge or collusion with the captain of the *Meshouda* and even wants him returned to Morocco in irons
- BW2:456: [James Simpson]() urges that the cargo of the *Meshouda* be restored, in the spirit of honoring the agreement with the emperor, even though the *Meshouda* did not itself honor the agreement (20 June 1803)
- - BW2:275: Simpson and Campbell asked for voucher from the emperor of Morocco that the Tripolitan ship was actually his, and he gave it to them: " she carrys Our Victorious Flag, and goes on the fulfillment of Our Orders and intentions. - Let no one oppose her or hinder her, neither do her any Injury; and we Order all the Consuls to despatch her, and deliver their Passports." 
- BW2:337-38: After a passport was granted to the Meshouda, apparently its captain felt that the [USS *Adams*]() ([Hugh G. Campbell]()) was just waiting outside Gibraltar to capture it if it left; therefore, Meshouda stayed in Gibraltar and its captain filed a complaint with the Moroccan government (24 December 1802)
- BW2:470-71: [James Simpson]() outlines the benefits/detriments of [Richard Valentine Morris]()'s plan to let the Meshouda be condemned by an international court: "I am well aware that the circumstances of the Meshouda case would justify Commodore Morris going to every rigour with her, were the Ship under the Flag of any Power by whom the Law of Nations is observed, but I conclude he made a distinction when in his Letter to me he says, "she shall not be Condemned if proved that this was not the "Order of the Emperour. It is however expected that the "Captain will be severely punished if it is an Act of his own." It was upon this principle and not from any sense of Justice on their side that I expressed my hopes to the Commodore the Ship would be liberated: --her Condemnation I am fully persuaded would give the highest disgust to the Emperour, on the contrary its my oppinion her release would afford me, after what has happened, a happy opportunity of makeing a strong impression on his Majestys mind of the Friendly intentions of the Government of the United States towards him" (9 July 1803)
- BW2:513: [James Leander Cathcart]() writes to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that he feels the taking of the *Meshouda* as prize has caused "a rupture with Morocco & caused a division of our force at the moment when it could have been render'd the most serviciable" (15 August 1803)
