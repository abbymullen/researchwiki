- Captured by [USS *John Adams*](), 13 May 1803. [Richard Valentine Morris]() writes to [James Simpson](): "last Evening the U. S. Frigate John Adam arrived at this place from her station off the Port of Tripoli and brought in with her the ship Messudar [Meshouda] claimed by the Emperor of Morrocco as his Property, and which notwithstanding your declaring in your Passport that Blockaded Ports were to be respected was taken [13 May 1803] in attempting to go into Tripoli with a considerable number of Guns Cutlashes Hem & other contraband articles that were not on Board when she left Gibralter, and not expressed in her Passports - She shall not be condemned if proved that this was not the orders of the Emperor - It is however expected that the Captain will be severely punished if it is an act of his own - There are also twenty Tripoline subjects on Board - in short this whole business appears to be a detestable Fraud" (BW2:408)
