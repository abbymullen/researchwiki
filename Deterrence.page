- Orders given to [Richard Dale](): "Should the Bey of Tripoli have declared War (as he has threatened) against the United States - you will then proceed direct to that Port, where you will lay your ships in such a position as effectually to prevent any of their Vessels from going in or out. The *Essex* & *Enterprize* by cruising well on towards Tunis, will have it in their power to intercept any vessels which they may have captured, - By disguising your ships, it will be some weeks before they will know that the Squadron is cruising in the Mediterranean - and give you a fair chance of punishing them" (BW1:467)
- Orders given to [Samuel Barron]() by [Richard Dale](), 25 Oct 1801: " I dont expect there will be any great Necessity of you being much at sea this Winter. You will take a look now and then into Tripoli, to let
that fellow sea and know that you are on the look out for him" (BW1:603)
