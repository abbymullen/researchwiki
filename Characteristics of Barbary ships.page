# Acquisition
- [Richard O'Brien]() makes a list of the Algerine force (15 vessels) and where the ships came from (BW2:71, 1 March and 20 May 1802):
    - 5 from Algiers
    - 5 from the USA
    - 3 from Greece
    - 2 unidentified


# Manpower
- Often manned by European dissidents and expatriates
    - "I Suspect many Vagabonds will enter that Service [cruising against American ships] for want of employment in the Privateering line" (BW1:633)
- In Richard O'Brien's list, he notes the captains of the Algerine vessels: only 3 Algerine; the rest Levantine (BW2:71)
