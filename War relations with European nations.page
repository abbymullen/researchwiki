# Need for the Europeans
- BW2:298: [William Eaton]() decries European interest in helping America: "I know we have some politicians among us who talk of reliance on the magnanimity of the great powers of Europe to interfere in our behalf - When the lion and the lamb shall lie down together this event will take place; but while jarring interests agitate this world and while the greater powers of Europe are actuated by a counting-house policy, in stead of relying on their magnanimity we must think of defending ourselves against their intrigue here...If there were no Barbary States England and France would erect them" (16 October 1802) 
- BW2:305: [William Eaton]() again: "Far from receiving any succour from the magnanimity of the great nations of Europe, we have now demonstrations of their policy to use these instruments of piracy as impediments to the growth of our commerce. Why does Bonaparte, at this peculiar crisis, give Tripoli a cruiser? Why has England assisted the escape of the Tripoline admiral and his soldiers? The object is so clear that the regencies themselves cannot but percieve it: and it encourages their insolence. They have formed an idea that the U States are too far off to coerce them - and the operations of our force have hitherto but confirmed
them in this security" (22 October 1802)
- 27 April 1804: [Thomas Jefferson]() frets that the loss of the [USS *Philadelphia*]() will set up obligations with the European powers that will derail the fight with Tripoli: "I have never been so mortified as at the conduct of our foreign functionaries on the loss of the Philadelphia. They appear to have supposed that we were all lost now, & without resource: and they have hawked us in forma pauperis begging alms at every court in Europe. This self-degradation is the more unpardonable as, uninstructed & unauthorized, they have taken measures which commit us by moral obligations which cannot be disavowed. The most serious of these is with the first consul of France, the Emperor of Russia & Grand Seigneur. The interposition of the two first has been so prompt, so cordial, so energetic, that it is impossible for us to decline the good offices they have done us. From the virtuous & warm-hearted character of the Emperor, and the energy he is using with the Ottoman Porte, I am really apprehensive that our squadron will, on it's arrival, find our prisoners all restored. If this should be the case, it would be ungrateful and insulting to these three great powers, to chastise the friend (Tripoli) whom they had induced to do us voluntary justice. Our expedition will in that case be disarmed and our just desires of vengeance disappointed, and our honor prostrated." (https://memory.loc.gov/service/mss/mtj//mtj1/030/030_0473_0474.pdf)

# Relations with the Americans

- 30 July 1801: [Richard Dale]() warns [Andrew Sterett]() to make sure his men behave in [Malta](), and to obey the laws of the port (BW1:534)
- 27 August 1802: SecNav to [Richard Valentine Morris](): "You will cordially co-operate with the Swedes and with every other nation at War with those Barbary Powers that may have declared or waged war against us. At the same time you will cautiously avoid whatever may have a tendency to bring us in collision with any friendly State." (BW2:258)

## Spain/Algeciras
- 15 August 1801: Spanish are actually the ones taking American ships, according to 2Lt. [John Johnson](), on board the [USS *Philadelphia*]() off Gibraltar (BW1:550)
- 28 September 1801: [Richard Dale]() writes to the governor of Algeciras (Spain) asking for an explanation of his conduct toward American merchant vessels and his refusal to allow the [USS Philadelphia]() to dock at Algeciras: "it was expected that the United States was at Peace with all the World" (BW1:586)
- 1 October 1801: [Richard Dale]() writes, "if the citizens, of the United States is suffered to be treated in this manner by those small Gun boats & Privatiers of a nation that protends to be in friendship; they had much better be at open war" (BW1:590)
- 18 October 1801: [Richard Dale](): "If there is not a stop put to such nefarious conduct as is carried on here at present, towards the Americans there is no knowing where it will end, particularly as the Owners of the Privatiers and Privatiersmen, have to pay no damages let them be ever so wrong in their conduct, It is very strange to me, that the King of Spain suffers such nefarious conduct to be carried on under his Flag. It is a disgrace to the nation, It is said that Gibraltar is in a state of Blockade, it must be a Blockade of Privatiers for there is not a Kings Vessel of any discription, to be seen at sea...If the King of Spain thinks he dos England or the Inhabitance of Gibraltar any Injury by the supposed Blockade he is very much mistaken, tis his friends the Americans that is Injured the most by it, by the Privatiers capturing all the Americans bound through the Straits, under pretext that they are bound to Gibraltar. " (BW1:600)
- 19 October 1801: [Richard Dale]() to [Don John Atonia de Espino](): I am happy in declaring to you Sir from Every Infermation that I have received since I have been here, that in the Tribunal wherein you Preside, you have shown a disposition to do Every Justice to the Americans, respecting the above transaction you did not hesitate in telling me that there was no Just caus to detain the ship from me, I am fully persuaded as far as respects your self, that you would not countenence any one Act wherein you thought, that it would have a tendency to lessen the good understanding which subsists between the two Nations at present, which I most sincerely hope will be lasting" (BW1:601) 
- The Americans continue to have problems with Spain: The fortification at St. Roque attacked two American vessels, killing one man, in October 1801, whereupon [Richard Dale]() wrote to the governor, stating "I
cannot help observing to your Excellency that I conceive such conduct
more resembles the Savages than a civilized nation." (BW1:609)
    - **Important**: Dale puts all the blame for this on the governor of St. Roque, and does not want to believe that this behavior is sanctioned by the king (see BW1:611); threatens consequences if the king is in fact aware of his governor's behavior. (See [Honor]().)
    - A court of inquiry into the conduct of the two forts was conducted, and it seems that the officers were convicted? At least "still in confinement." And [Richard Dale]() states that he would have consented to acquittal of the officers; "Your excellency may be assured it is my wish, that the transaction may be Buried in oblevion, Hoping that nothing of the kind will take place again" (BW2:20, 7 March 1802)
- [Alexander Murray]() writes to [Charles Pinckney]() to ask him to obtain a general permission for American naval vessels to haul into the mole of Malaga (and possibly Cadiz) if necessary, as merely staying in the outer roads offers little protection from the elements (BW2:324, 26 November 1802)
    - Also apparently wrote to [John Graham](), head of the U.S. legation at Madrid, about a more general permission for any Spanish port (BW2:332)


## Scandinavia
### [Sweden]()

- BW1:576: [James Leander Cathcart]() discourages a coalition with Sweden, on the basis that he does not want to share the glory and honor of setting an example with the Barbary states (see [Honor]()), 17 September 1801
    - BW1:599: Despite Cathcart's objections, N. [Frumerie]() writes to [William Eaton]() that the Swedes have been ordered by the king to cooperate with the Americans against Tripoli and so a squadron of 3 frigates and a cutter brig are coming to the Med for that purpose, as well as providing convoy duty for American vessels, 14 October 1801
    - BW1:637: Eaton too seems to caution against a Swedish alliance: "what American can cheerfully admit the idea that the United States will think it proper to divide with any nation whatever the honor and the advantages of chastising Tripoli: The object itself does not seem to require such a parade" (13 December 1801) 
- BW1:626: Relations were friendly enough that Lt. [Stephen Decatur]() went on board the Swedish frigate *[Thetis]()*, 27 November 1801
    - BW1:627: Continued agreeable relations between the *[USS Essex]()* and the *Thetis*, 30 November 1801
- BW2:20: [Richard Dale]() expects to consult with Admiral [Soderstrom]() about the best way to jointly protect the two nations' commerce, 13 January 1802
    - BW2:28: Soderstrom reports that he has ordered a frigate to Tripoli and is also going there himself; he has put two frigates on convoy duty at Malaga (25 January 1802)
    - BW2:46: Dale writes to Soderstrom that he has ordered the [USS *Boston*]() to act in conjunction with the Swedes off Tripoli, and he offers some advice to Soderstrom about how an attack might be made on the port, 2 February 1802 

### Denmark
- 28 August 1801: Danish commodore will not swap information with [Richard Dale](), though [Nicholas Nissen]() has been a help to the squadron (BW1:562)
- 10 May 1802: [Nicholas Nissen]() writes to [James Leander Cathcart]() about the state of affairs between Sweden and Tripoli (BW2:148)
    - Treaty negotiations don't seem to be going well
    - Nissen illustrates the delicate balance he has to walk between fulfilling his duty to Denmark as consul, and helping the Americans as he had promised to do
    - Nissen reports that the Swedes have told the bashaw that they can't negotiate a treaty without consulting the Americans, because they are closely allied---this is exactly the opposite of how the Americans had been playing it.
    - Also suggests that France is the one trying to broker the deal between Sweden and Tripoli (need independent corroboration of this?)
    - "they [advisors to the bashaw] endeavour most strenuously to keep them [other plans] secret from me, they do me the justice to believe that I will never admit an thing that I believe to be contrary to the interests of the U.S. & for the same reasons, the Bashaw wishes some other person to be encharged with American affairs when a Negotiation takes place more congenial to his interest"
    - Nissen's advice: Don't try to start negotiations until you have naval vessels off Tripoli and are here yourself; Nissen feels certain he would not be allowed to personally communicate with the American commodore, but if Cathcart is there in person, the bashaw's court might be more willing to allow the two diplomats to confer
- Nissen had been operating as sort of a stand-in consul for the USA in Tripoli, but the bashaw made it a condition of Nissen's continued status for Denmark that he would stop negotiating on the USA's behalf: "the Bashaw has formally requested that I should renounce all interference in the affairs of any other nation but my own, he has made it an article of our convention with him, and mentioned it likewise at the audience - I am constantly your Friend, Dr Sir, and shall be glad to do every thing in my power to serve you and the United States of America; but I cannot appear as your charge des affairs, and I believe no person at Tripoli will; I must henceforth demand the greatest Secrecy in our correspondence and please to inform Mr Eaton likewise thereof" (BW2:229, 10 August 1802)
    - "Advise Dr Sir, the Commanders of your Frigates not to write any thing to me that requires Secrecy"
- BW2:234: [Alexander Murray]() records an encounter between the [USS *Constellation*]() and three Danish frigates. He brought the flagship to, and sent Lt. Stewart aboard to find out whether the Danish knew that the Americans were blockading Tripoli, and to ask (without actually asking) whether the Danes intended to honor the blockade or not. They did not get an answer from the Danes about their intentions, and the Danish frigates anchored off Tripoli for 12 days before leaving in the middle of the night. Murray gave chase and brought one of the vessels to, where they had a perfectly routine conversation about the number of captures made by the Tripolitans and how many Tripolitan cruisers were out (14 August 1802)
- BW2:354: the Danish consul at Tunis agreed to stand as security for some of [William Eaton]()'s debts, after a big scrum with the bey (5 March 1803)

## France
- 28 September 1801: French took several American vessels as prize in the Mediterranean (BW1:585)
- 8 December 1801: [Richard Dale]() is affronted by the actions of the commandant of Marine at Toulon who sent a guard to ensure the Americans followed the rules of quarantine: "Such a custom may be very necessary on Board of Merchant Vessels but will not be permitted on board of Ships of War Belonging to the United States, nor will it be, on Board the President, so long as I Have the honor to Command therefore I send him on shore" (BW1:630)
- It was important to Dale that the USA be treated as part of the international community, not as a second-class citizen, by the commandant of Toulon: "I expect to receive the same Hospitality and Attention in this port that is given to the most favoured Nation." (BW1:630)
- BW2:302: [Alexander Murray]() writes that the custom house in Toulon requires tonnage money from all vessels: "the Custom house hath demanded Tonnage money of those Vessels, to the Amount of one hundred & forty five Crowns for the Brig & nearly an equal sum-for the Schooner - If this principle is adhered too, it will destroy the intent & purpose of Convoy's, as we are obliged to call in at the various Ports in our tract, to collect our Vessels, & if they are to be subjected to Port charges in every Port, it will be so heavy a tax upon them, that they will be induced to run greater risks than they woud otherwise do, & occassion the Capture of many of them" (20 October 1802) (See [Convoy]().)
    - Murray writes to Gen. Gantheaume, French commander at Toulon, thanking him for his kind attention and aid while Murray was getting his rudder repaired there, and he doesn't mention the tonnage money at all (20 October 1802, BW2:302-3)
    - Murray further reports: " I there met with the most Polite, & friendly reception nor woud they suffer me to pay any thing for the services rendered, I had only to make a triffling present to the workman, but the Merchant Vessels, that accompanied me were subjected to such heavy charges from the Custom house, that I thought It my duty to represent the matter to our Minister at Paris" (BW2:310)
- BW2:353: The French agent, Mr. Devoize, at Tunis offered to be responsible for [William Eaton]()'s debts, but [Richard Valentine Morris]() didn't like his attitude, so he declined (4 March 1803)
- BW2:445: French consul at Tripoli guaranteed the safety of [Richard Valentine Morris]() and the negotiating team (7 June 1803)

## Great Britain
- "It is expected that the Port of Gibraltar will be open to your squadron. It is not doubted but that you will be received with hospitality & friendship in the Spanish Ports of Carthagena, Barcelona & the French Port of Toulon - at Leghorn & Naples, Palermo & Syracuse - Nor is it conceived that there will be any obstacle made to your entering the Ports of Malta, now in possession of the British. Letters will be written on this subject to our several ministers & to our consuls in the Mediterranean, & other convenient Ports, to enable them to give proper explanations, & to enjoin on them the attentions & Offices they may be able to render the expedition" (BW1:468)
- 29 June 1801: Hailed British fleet near Cadiz with proper ceremony (BW1:495)
- 10 August 1801: [James Leander Cathcart]() sees a British conspiracy around every corner: "I imagine [the Tripolitan admiral] was encouraged by his friends Lucas & McDonogh who were continually intoxicated together" (BW1:545-46)
- Mahon: Governor of Mahon assures [Richard Dale]() that if there were corsairs fitting out at Mahon to capture Americans, he would certainly put a stop to it, and that he would ensure that a ship being built for the Bey of Tunis was not actually for Tripoli (BW1:634)
- Malta: [Samuel Barron]() receives a favorable reception from [Lord Keith]() and the British officers at Malta
- Gibraltar: [William Bainbridge]() and [Richard Dale]() visit Sir [James Saumarez](), 27 February 1802 (BW2:68)
    - Bainbridge visits again, 24 March 1802 (BW2:96)
- [Richard Dale]() writes that he has been treated "with every mark of attention" by all the British officers and diplomats he has met (BW2:70)
- [Richard Dale]() receives information from Sir [James Saumarez]() about pirates in Gibraltar Bay--the two seem to be on good terms (BW2:116)
- [Lord Keith]() writes to [Alexander Murray]() thanking them for honoring the Duke of Kent at Gibraltar when he was there (BW2:150, 10 May 1802)
- [William Eaton]() blames the English for helping the Tripolitans with both ship and the escape of Murad Reis from Gibraltar: "Have we still in America any body who believes in English Magnamity!" (BW2:228, 7 August 1802)
- [Alexander Murray]() reports very favorable reception at Malta from Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton and Gov. Alexander Ball, 22 August 1802 (BW2:247)
- [James Simpson]() notes that there are French and British privateers in the seas around Morocco; the British detain any neutral vessels they find coming to or from French ports (28 July 1803, BW2:500)
- BW3:21-22: [Thomas Trigge](), governor of Gibraltar, is prepared to admit the [*Meshouda*]() to Gibraltar provided [John Gavino]() is not planning to sell any part of her; he also notes, "I also hope that she may not long remain in this Port as it will tend to embroil us with the Empr of Morrocco; the Mischivious consequences of which you are well acquainted with" (6 September 1803) 
    - BW3:22: [John Gavino]() demurs: he doesn't think it will be sold but he can't guarantee it; but he assures Trigge that the commodore will "act in every respect so as to prevent any Embroils, and at same time keep up the good Harmoney which subsists between His Majy the King of the United Kingdoms and the Goverment of the U. S. of America" (6 September 1803)

## Naples
- Lt. [John Shaw]() reports that Naples wants to make a treaty with the USA, and that the governor of Naples has given orders to accommodate the American navy in any way possible, 9 February 1802 (BW2:57)
- 

# Relations amongst European nations
- 12 July 1801: American navy in Gibraltar gets to watch a battle between the English and the French off Algeciras (BW1:519)
- 10 May 1802: [Richard O'Brien](): "by The definitive treaty there seems to be a prospect of a reform takeing place in The Barbary System, it is Much wanted"---a change in relations between England and France might change their relationships to the Barbary states, and by extension the Barbary states' relations with the USA (BW2:147) 
- 30 November 1802: [Daniel Carmick]() thinks that the English and the French may start up hostilities again over Malta, as neither navy wants to give the island up or go home (BW2:327)
- 5 July 1803: [Edward Preble]() notes that a resumption of hostilities between England and France could be good?: "Certain accounts have been received here of a Declaration of War by England against France- This circumstance while it renders the situation of our Squadron intended for the Mideteranean more interesting, and Delicate, will I presume ensure it, the most respectfull treatment from both the Belligerent powers - as it will be for their interest to keep on good terms with this Government." He also suggests that war is good for recruitment: "The certainty of War increases our Success in recruiting foreign Seamen, as they dare not trust to the protection the Merchant Service affords them, and are sure of being safe from impressment with us" (BW2:468)
