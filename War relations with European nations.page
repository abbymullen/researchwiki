The navy needed to know where they could reasonably expect a favorable reception among ports in the Mediterranean. 


- "It is expected that the Port of Gibraltar will be open to your squadron. It is not doubted but that you will be received with hospitality & friendship in the Spanish Ports of Carthagena, Barcelona & the French Port of Toulon - at Leghorn & Naples, Palermo & Syracuse - Nor is it conceived that there will be any obstacle made to your entering the Ports of Malta, now in possession of the British. Letters will be written on this subject to our several ministers & to our consuls in the Mediterranean, & other convenient Ports, to enable them to give proper explanations, & to enjoin on them the attentions & Offices they may be able to render the expedition" (BW1:468)

- 10 August 1801: [James Leander Cathcart]() sees a British conspiracy around every corner: "I imagine [the Tripolitan admiral] was encouraged by his friends Lucas & McDonogh who were continually intoxicated together" (BW1:545-46)

- 28 September 1801: French took several American vessels as prize in the Mediterranean (BW1:585)

## Spain/Algeciras

- 28 September 1801: [Richard Dale]() writes to the governor of Algeciras (Spain) asking for an explanation of his conduct toward American merchant vessels and his refusal to allow the [USS Philadelphia]() to dock at Algeciras: "it was expected that the United States was at Peace with all the World" (BW1:586)
- 1 October 1801: [Richard Dale]() writes, "if the citizens, of the United States is suffered to be treated in this manner by those small Gun boats & Privatiers of a nation that protends to be in friendship; they had much better be at open war" (BW1:590)
- 18 October 1801: [Richard Dale](): "If there is not a stop put to such nefarious conduct as is carried on here at present, towards the Americans there is no knowing where it will end, particularly as the Owners of the Privatiers and Privatiersmen, have to pay no damages let them be ever so wrong in their conduct, It is very strange to me, that the King of Spain suffers such nefarious conduct to be carried on under his Flag. It is a disgrace to the nation, It is said that Gibraltar is in a state of Blockade, it must be a Blockade of Privatiers for there is not a Kings Vessel of any discription, to be seen at sea...If the King of Spain thinks he dos England or the Inhabitance of Gibraltar any Injury by the supposed Blockade he is very much mistaken, tis his friends the Americans that is Injured the most by it, by the Privatiers capturing all the Americans bound through the Straits, under pretext that they are bound to Gibraltar. " (BW1:600)
- 19 October 1801: [Richard Dale]() to [Don John Atonia de Espino](): I am happy in declaring to you Sir from Every Infermation that I have received since I have been here, that in the Tribunal wherein you Preside, you have shown a disposition to do Every Justice to the Americans, respecting the above transaction you did not hesitate in telling me that there was no Just caus to detain the ship from me, I am fully persuaded as far as respects your self, that you would not countenence any one Act wherein you thought, that it would have a tendency to lessen the good understanding which subsists between the two Nations at present, which I most sincerely hope will be lasting" (BW1:601) 
- The Americans continue to have problems with Spain: The fortification at St. Roque attacked two American vessels, killing one man, in October 1801, whereupon [Richard Dale]() wrote to the governor, stating "I
cannot help observing to your Excellency that I conceive such conduct
more resembles the Savages than a civilized nation." (BW1:609)
    - **Important**: Dale puts all the blame for this on the governor of St. Roque, and does not want to believe that this behavior is sanctioned by the king (see BW1:611); threatens consequences if the king is in fact aware of his governor's behavior. (See [Honor]().)
    - A court of inquiry into the conduct of the two forts was conducted, and it seems that the officers were convicted? At least "still in confinement." And [Richard Dale]() states that he would have consented to acquittal of the officers; "Your excellency may be assured it is my wish, that the transaction may be Buried in oblevion, Hoping that nothing of the kind will take place again" (BW2:20, 7 March 1802)

    - BW1:599: Despite Cathcart's objections, N. [Frumerie]() writes to [William Eaton]() that the Swedes have been ordered by the king to cooperate with the Americans against Tripoli and so a squadron of 3 frigates and a cutter brig are coming to the Med for that purpose, as well as providing convoy duty for American vessels, 14 October 1801
    - BW1:637: Eaton too seems to caution against a Swedish alliance: "what American can cheerfully admit the idea that the United States will think it proper to divide with any nation whatever the honor and the advantages of chastising Tripoli: The object itself does not seem to require such a parade" (13 December 1801) 
- BW1:626: Relations were friendly enough that Lt. [Stephen Decatur]() went on board the Swedish frigate *[Thetis]()*, 27 November 1801

- It was important to Dale that the USA be treated as part of the international community, not as a second-class citizen, by the commandant of Toulon: "I expect to receive the same Hospitality and Attention in this port that is given to the most favoured Nation." (BW1:630)

## Great Britain
- Mahon: Governor of Mahon assures [Richard Dale]() that if there were corsairs fitting out at Mahon to capture Americans, he would certainly put a stop to it, and that he would ensure that a ship being built for the Bey of Tunis was not actually for Tripoli (BW1:634)
