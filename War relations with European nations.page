It is not doubted but that you will be received with hospitality & friendship in the Spanish Ports of Carthagena, Barcelona & the French Port of Toulon - at Leghorn & Naples, Palermo & Syracuse - Nor is it conceived that there will be any obstacle made to your entering the Ports of Malta, now in possession of the British. Letters will be written on this subject to our several ministers & to our consuls in the Mediterranean, & other convenient Ports, to enable them to give proper explanations, & to enjoin on them the attentions & Offices they may be able to render the expedition" (BW1:468)

It is a disgrace to the nation, It is said that Gibraltar is in a state of Blockade, it must be a Blockade of Privatiers for there is not a Kings Vessel of any discription, to be seen at sea...If the King of Spain thinks he dos England or the Inhabitance of Gibraltar any Injury by the supposed Blockade he is very much mistaken, tis his friends the Americans that is Injured the most by it, by the Privatiers capturing all the Americans bound through the Straits, under pretext that they are bound to Gibraltar.

- The Americans continue to have problems with Spain: The fortification at St. Roque attacked two American vessels, killing one man, in October 1801, whereupon [Richard Dale]() wrote to the governor, stating "I

more resembles the Savages than a civilized nation." (BW1:609)
