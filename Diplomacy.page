## Great Britain
- Possible treaty violation: [Richard Dale]() writes to the governor of Minorca about the rumor that Tripolitan corsairs have been sailing under British colors and protection. He cites the treaty between Great Britain and the United States (articles 21 and 24); "I am Very confident . . . that it is [the king's] wish that the present good understanding between the two Nations should not be disturbed....I am very willing to beleave that your Excellency would not suffer any transaction within the limits of your Government, knowingly to be done, that would tend in the smallest degree to desturbe that good understanding which subsists between the two Nations at present." He concludes with his solution: "Should any Vessel or Vessels such as I have described have gone to Sea, or intend going, and should any ships of the Squadron, which I have the Honor to Command fall in with any of them as I have given orders accordingly, I hope the Commanders, and my self, will be excused for not paying that attention to the British Flag, in that situation which it so Highly Merits when displayed in its proper place" (BW1:623, 19 November 1801)
