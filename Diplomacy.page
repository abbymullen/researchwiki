Title: "Olive Branch in One Hand"?

## Diplomats' orders
- SecState to [James Leander Cathcart](): "However able this country may be to carry on the war with effect, the expence and trouble of it, and the encreased risk whilst at war with one of the Barbary powers, are with the President just motives of solicitude for the success of your negotiation" (10 May 1802, BW2:147)


## Naval officers' relations with non-belligerent Barbary States
- [Richard Dale](): writes to bey of Tunis and dey of Algiers to let them know of the squadron's presence and to assure them of his respect, and to commend the American consuls to them (BW1:508)

## Naval officers' relations with Tripoli
- [Richard Dale]() writes to the bashaw of Tripoli asking to know why he has declared war, but also reminding the bashaw that he as a naval commander has no power to make treaties, 28 July 1801 (BW1:533-534)
- [Richard Dale]() uses [Nicholas Nissen]() to try to effect a prisoner exchange with [Yusuf Karamanli](), 2 September 1801 (BW1:568, BW1:594)
- [James Leander Cathcart]() suggests to [Richard Dale]() that he should try to intercept the Tripoline ambassador, who was going to Algiers to try to "influence the Dey of Algiers espouse his master's cause," 13 October 1801 (BW1:598)--that's one way to keep diplomacy from succeeding...
- For some reason, the 1802 peace commission of [James Leander Cathcart]() explicitly excludes the naval squadron commodore (BW2:130)

# [Naval officers' relations with their own diplomats]()

# Diplomacy with other nations

- 

## Great Britain
- Possible treaty violation: [Richard Dale]() writes to the governor of Minorca about the rumor that Tripolitan corsairs have been sailing under British colors and protection. He cites the treaty between Great Britain and the United States (articles 21 and 24); "I am Very confident . . . that it is [the king's] wish that the present good understanding between the two Nations should not be disturbed....I am very willing to beleave that your Excellency would not suffer any transaction within the limits of your Government, knowingly to be done, that would tend in the smallest degree to desturbe that good understanding which subsists between the two Nations at present." He concludes with his solution: "Should any Vessel or Vessels such as I have described have gone to Sea, or intend going, and should any ships of the Squadron, which I have the Honor to Command fall in with any of them as I have given orders accordingly, I hope the Commanders, and my self, will be excused for not paying that attention to the British Flag, in that situation which it so Highly Merits when displayed in its proper place" (BW1:623, 19 November 1801)
    - 20 November 1801: the governor replies that he knows nothing about it and will not let any ship leave that meets the description Dale provided (BW1:624)
