Title: "Olive Branch in One Hand"?

## Diplomats' orders
- SecState to [James Leander Cathcart](): "However able this country may be to carry on the war with effect, the expence and trouble of it, and the encreased risk whilst at war with one of the Barbary powers, are with the President just motives of solicitude for the success of your negotiation" (10 May 1802, BW2:147)
- SecNav to [Richard Valentine Morris](), writes that he is to take a primary role in negotiations with any Barbary state, though he is requested to bring [James Leander Cathcart]() into the negotiations if possible (BW2:257, 27 August 1802)


## Naval officers' relations with non-belligerent Barbary States
- [Richard Dale](): writes to bey of Tunis and dey of Algiers to let them know of the squadron's presence and to assure them of his respect, and to commend the American consuls to them (BW1:508)

## Naval officers' relations with Tripoli
- [Richard Dale]() writes to the bashaw of Tripoli asking to know why he has declared war, but also reminding the bashaw that he as a naval commander has no power to make treaties, 28 July 1801 (BW1:533-534)
- [Richard Dale]() uses [Nicholas Nissen]() to try to effect a prisoner exchange with [Yusuf Karamanli](), 2 September 1801 (BW1:568, BW1:594)
- [James Leander Cathcart]() suggests to [Richard Dale]() that he should try to intercept the Tripoline ambassador, who was going to Algiers to try to "influence the Dey of Algiers espouse his master's cause," 13 October 1801 (BW1:598)--that's one way to keep diplomacy from succeeding...
- For some reason, the 1802 peace commission of [James Leander Cathcart]() explicitly excludes the naval squadron commodore (BW2:130)
- BW2:398: [James Leander Cathcart]() remonstrates with [Richard Valentine Morris]() to let him take part in the negotiations with Tripoli: "In vain did I point out to Comodore Morris the difficulties he would have to encounter should he attempt a negotiation with Tripoli without a faithful co-adjutor unacquainted as he is with the language customs & manner of negotiating with Barbarians, I quoted the embarrassing situation he had just emerged from at Tunis on the first moment he had ever landed in my of the Barbary States, I infom'd him that the Bashaw would employ those who were entirely devoted to his interest who would endeavor to take advantage of his ignorance of their situation & placed in a striking point of view the probability of his being deceiv'd in a manner similar to the Swedish Comodore Tornquist in 1801 already detail'd to government, neither did I omit mentioning how extremely trifling it would appear to government when they would be inform'd that he had taken me all round the mediterranean without giving me an opportunity of puting into execution any part of my instructions, the Comodore answer'd that he had receiv'd instrucbons that superceded mine & as I had furnished him with a copy of the Treaty which I had drawn out he could do without me & again repeated that he would send for me should he want my assistance" (5 May 1803)
- BW2:441: [Richard Valentine Morris]() allows the minister of war to come on board with a letter for Morris, suggesting that peace could be negotiated; because of wind, the minister and his entourage are not able to return that day, and so spend the night on board the [USS *New York*](): " he [the minister] observ'd that at any time when we wanted anything we could stand in & hoist the white flag & if it was answer'd by the Fort, we might with safety come on shore to purchase every thing wanted, he said that the Bashaw was very Angry with his officers for firing the gun at the Schooner" (4 June 1803)

# [Naval officers' relations with their own diplomats]()

# Diplomacy with other nations

The question each commodore had to ask himself was this: Was it more important to maintain peace with all the other possible belligerents, and thus possibly neglect war with Tripoli? Or work toward a quick peace with Tripoli while neglecting the peace with the other nations in the Mediterranean?

For [Richard Dale](), neither one of those options looked promising. Hobbled by the lack of authorization to use force against Tripoli, he likewise had not enough money, stores, or time to placate the other Barbary states effectively. [Richard Valentine Morris]() chose early on, it would seem, to focus his attentions on keeping the other Barbary states happy---he spent almost no time off Tripoli, instead dealing personally with the troubles in Morocco and Tunis. (See BW2:348, letter from [James Leander Cathcart]() to SecState, 25 January 1803)

## Denmark
- [William Eaton]() is recognized and rewarded by the king of Denmark for his service to them in some capacity (BW1:621)
- 

## Great Britain
- Possible treaty violation: [Richard Dale]() writes to the governor of Minorca about the rumor that Tripolitan corsairs have been sailing under British colors and protection. He cites the treaty between Great Britain and the United States (articles 21 and 24); "I am Very confident . . . that it is [the king's] wish that the present good understanding between the two Nations should not be disturbed....I am very willing to beleave that your Excellency would not suffer any transaction within the limits of your Government, knowingly to be done, that would tend in the smallest degree to desturbe that good understanding which subsists between the two Nations at present." He concludes with his solution: "Should any Vessel or Vessels such as I have described have gone to Sea, or intend going, and should any ships of the Squadron, which I have the Honor to Command fall in with any of them as I have given orders accordingly, I hope the Commanders, and my self, will be excused for not paying that attention to the British Flag, in that situation which it so Highly Merits when displayed in its proper place" (BW1:623, 19 November 1801)
    - 20 November 1801: the governor replies that he knows nothing about it and will not let any ship leave that meets the description Dale provided (BW1:624)
    - 


## France
- Big incident with Captain [Daniel McNeill](): Lied to the quarantine officer at [Toulon]() about where he had stopped in the Mediterranean in order to avoid a lengthy quarantine; he additionally left port with three French officers and an officer from the [USS *President*]() on board (BW2:28)
- BW2:292: The commander of the French division at Leghorn demanded a sailor off the [USS *Constellation*](), who they claimed was being detained. [Alexander Murray]() claimed instead that the man was Swiss, taken by a French privateer and then captured by the Americans off the American coast, and that he had joined the *Constellation* of his own free will; Murray requested that [Thomas Appleton]() convey this information to the French division (12 October 1802)

## Tunis
- Instead of making an international incident over the capture of a Tunisian xebec by [Andrew Sterett](), the bey of Tunis invites [William Eaton]() to talk about allowing Tunis to help negotiate a treaty between the USA and Tripoli (BW2:159, 24 May 1802)
    - Tunisian official argues that the only reason Tripoli broke with the USA was pressure from Algiers, and wants to restore the relationship
    - Small presents would of course be expected for Tunis's mediatorial role
    - Eaton is not convinced that going through Tunis is a good idea: "These overtures go to prove the embarrassed situation of our enemy; and promise, if suitable advantage is taken of it, a peace on our own terms. We hold the high grounds of him at all points" 
    - Eaton notes that Tunis is not aware of Eaton's master plan for restoring [Hamet Karamanli](); in the meantime, "let us amuse the usurper with his own propositions"

## Algiers
- BW2:224: [William Eaton]() hears that the dey of Algiers has demanded that the bashaw of Tripoli release the prisoners from the [Franklin](), declaring that "the Americans were his best friends" because they had given his cargo transport to Constantinople when he needed it (in the [USS *George Washington*]()
    - Eaton is skeptical of the dey's motives in this declaration, seeing ulterior motives in his attempt to wriggle back into the USA's good graces; however, he is happy to have any help to bring the bashaw to terms (5 August 1802)

# Role of consul
- BW2:278: [Alexander Murray]() writes, "I have very great attention paid me by the Prime Minister Genl Aton [or Acton] & man of the first Class of Nobility here, they all seem surprized that a Nation riseing into consequence so rapidly as America, shou'd not have a proper Representitive at Naples, for the present Person, who acts as Consul, is very contemptable & not known by any one, & a French Man, with whom I have no communication, it wou'd be of great importance to the U. States to have a Commercial Treaty at least with Naples, for such Nations as hath, have great advantages over us" (18 September 1802)
- BW2:482: SecState writes, "The Regency of Algiers being of most importance to the United States, considering its influence with those of Tunis & Tripoli; and our stipulations with that Regency requiring the largest expenditures are the causes why the Consul General is established there. The relation of the Consuls for those other Regencies is therefore a subordinate one, and they will consequently be instructed to correspond regularly with you, as well as directly with the Department of State. In all cases of difficulty & urgency, they are to ask and follow your opinion, especially when the state of our affairs may require immediate decision, and where the sacrifice to be made is either of an occasional and not a permanent nature, or of no very high value. They are to keep regular journals of their proceedings, including their pecuniary transactions, and transmit transcripts, as often as may be to you. Of so strict a necessity is this latter duty that the d be given to understand that no allowance for disbursements will be made to them unless registered in their Journals at the time and transmitted both to you and this Department, with the very first Dispatches they may wnte to either, after the expense is incurred. The same duty will be incumbent upon youraeIf yth the Department of State." (14 July 1803)
