- Encouragement of commerce: "It is also thought that such a Squadron, commanded by some of our most gallant officers, known to be stationed in the Mediterranean, will give confidence to our Merchants, & tend greatly to increase the commerce of our country within those Seas" (BW1:465).
- BW1:470: [Thomas Jefferson]() to [Yusuf Karamanli](), bashaw of Tripoli, 21 May 1801: "We have found it expedient to detach a squadron of observation into the Mediterranean sea, to superintend the safety of our commerce there, and to exercise our seamen in nautical duties. We recommend them to your hospitality and good offices, should occasion require their resorting to your harbors. We hope their appearance will give umbrage to no Power: for, while we mean to rest the safety of our commerce on the resources of our own strength and bravery in every sea, we have yet given to this squadron in strict command to conduct themselves towards all friendly Powers with the most perfect respect and good order; it being the first object of our solicitude to cherish peace and friendship with all nations with whom it can be held on terms of equality and reciprocity." (Passive-aggressive much, TJ?)
