[NEED INFO ABOUT THE BEGINNING APPROPRIATIONS FROM 1794ff.]

- BW2:129: SecNav asks [William Eustis]() for an additional $100,000 to defray repair costs; plus $50,000 for repair of vessels in ordinary, 19 April 1802
- BW2:132: SecNav asks [William Ellery]() for the same amount of money he asked Eustis for, with these additional words: " $50,000 ought also to be added to the appropriation for the Navy Yards. The cost of the Timber of the U. S. - deposited and to be deposited in the several Navy Yards amounts to the sum of $580,000. - To provide adequate means for the water & dry seasoning of such valuable property is obviously an object of great national importance. Large Ware Houses are also indispensably necessary for the securing of the costly stores of the Department, and for preservation of the sails, Cables, and other furniture of the public Ships. These, combin'd with other considerations, will, I trust, suggest the expediency of appropriating at least $150,000 to the improvements of the Navy Yards." (22 April 1802)
