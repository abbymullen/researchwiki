Most of the time, it seems that the naval officers and the Mediterranean diplomats, if not completely in sync with each other, at least didn't get in each others' way. Sometimes they directly clashed, though.

### William Eaton
- BW2:145: [Alexander Murray]() takes [William Eaton]() to task for hiring the *Gloria* "on Public account" and tells him that he has dismissed the *Gloria* from public service, 6 May 1802: "However unpleasant a circumstance it is to disapprove of any measures which you have adopted & which I beleive you have deemed expedient, in your Zeal to serve our Country, yet as an Officer in the U. States service my Duty compels me to check all unwarrantable expences"
    - Not everyone agrees with Murray's perspective: Purser [Charles Wadsworth]() of the [USS *Boston*]() says that he thinks sending the *Gloria* to Gibraltar was the right idea, 20 May 1802 (BW2:161)
- BW2:146: [Alexander Murray]() does not have a high opinion of the diplomats; he writes to SecNav: " there are at this time a Squadron of Sweedish Frigates on that Coast [of Tripoli], so that we have but little to fear from any of the Barbary, States, tho our Consuls make a great fuss about nothing"
- [William Eaton]()'s plan for [Hamet Karamanli]() is not popular amongst the navy; he records that [Samuel Barron](), [William Bainbridge](), and [Alexander Murray]() offer "very severe criticism" of the plan (8 June 1802, BW2:166)
    - Eaton has some criticism of his own: he notes that almost none of the American ships have been off Tripoli for any length of time
        - [USS *Philadelphia*]() left Tunis for Tripoli on 23 September and returned 2 October, but she was "the only U State ship of war ... which has appeared at all on this coast since October until the arrival of the *Boston*"
        - *Philadelphia* spent the winter in Syracuse
        - [USS *Essex*]() stationed off Gibraltar
        - "This is a singularly economical mode of carrying on the war; and it is not extraordinary, if Gentlemen *feelingly* attached to it should take offence at a vigilance which should go to put an end to it" (BW2:166-67)
    - Eaton also feels that when he declared the blockade, the navy did not act decisively enough at that time and thus lost the opportunity for a swift resolution.
    - He reserves particular fury for [Alexander Murray](), suggesting that in his public reproval of the *Gloria* affair, he acted more like a Barbary ruler than like an American: "Had he possessed the delicacy due from one officer of the government to another, and sent my ship back to me with his opinion modestly expressed, I should have been reconciled to the manner, though not to the measure of his conduct; but to proclaim in the Consulate of the U States, at that place, my reprehensibility - to forbid the Consul furnishing the ship any Supplies - and to endeavor to take the seamen out of her as he really did two of them in his own barge (as if prepensel bent to distress me) are transactions at which a man of less sensibilty than myself could not but be moved"
        - He further avers that Murray never told him of his disapproval while they were actually together but just gave instructions to Captain Bounds as if Eaton were not there
        - Murray claimed that he could not take [Hamet Karamanli]() out of a neutral vessel; Eaton claimed that he was interpreting the Law of Nations incorrectly (see [International law]())
    - "I do not undertake to say that the commanders have not acted in conformity to orders - But I cannot forbear repeating, what I have so often insisted on, and what I fear we shall find true too late; Except more energy be thrown into our operations against Tripoli, we shall fail in our object; and, by a temporizing mode of warfare, encourage the other Barbary powers to become insolent This will not be found the prediction of a disordered fancy! All the frigates of the U States employed in cruising, or even in a blockade, are inadequate to prevent the small gallies of the enemy from stealing out and doing us mischief."
    - Eaton claims that the Swedish admiral is on board with his plan for [Hamet Karamanli](): "How is it that every Commander, as well as every body else who has acted on this coast comes into this measure; and that those only who have scarcely or never been here take on themselves to reject it!" (BW2:170) 
- Eaton laments that as he has refused to take bribes from any Barbary ruler, he has been holding the moral high ground, but "The postures I have taken and held here, since the war, have kept me in continual perplexity and embarrassment. Why? I have been badly supported - or rather not supported at all - It is to be hoped this will not always be the case - National Honor, interest, economy dictate otherwise - Gentlemen late in command say I am too fast - Capt Murray likewise. Perhaps it is because they are too slow." (BW2:228, 7 August 1802) 
- Eaton further excoriates [Alexander Murray]() to SecState: "Whatever may be Cap. Murray's opinion of my measures, he ought not to sacrifice the interest of service to individual resentments. Government may as well send out *quaker meeting-houses* to float about this sea as frigates with Murrays in command." (BW2:229, 9 August 1802)
