Most of the time, it seems that the naval officers and the Mediterranean diplomats, if not completely in sync with each other, at least didn't get in each others' way. Sometimes they directly clashed, though.

### *Gloria* affair
- BW2:145: [Alexander Murray]() takes [William Eaton]() to task for hiring the *Gloria* "on Public account" and tells him that he has dismissed the *Gloria* from public service, 6 May 1802: "However unpleasant a circumstance it is to disapprove of any measures which you have adopted & which I beleive you have deemed expedient, in your Zeal to serve our Country, yet as an Officer in the U. States service my Duty compels me to check all unwarrantable expences"
    - Not everyone agrees with Murray's perspective: Purser [Charles Wadsworth]() of the [USS *Boston*]() says that he thinks sending the *Gloria* to Gibraltar was the right idea, 20 May 1802 (BW2:161)
- BW2:146: [Alexander Murray]() does not have a high opinion of the diplomats; he writes to SecNav: " there are at this time a Squadron of Sweedish Frigates on that Coast [of Tripoli], so that we have but little to fear from any of the Barbary, States, tho our Consuls make a great fuss about nothing"
- [William Eaton]()'s plan for [Hamet Karamanli]() is not popular amongst the navy; he records that [Samuel Barron](), [William Bainbridge](), and [Alexander Murray]() offer "very severe criticism" of the plan (8 June 1802, BW2:166)
    - Eaton has some criticism of his own: he notes that almost none of the American ships have been off Tripoli for any length of time
        - [USS *Philadelphia*]() left Tunis for Tripoli on 23 September and returned 2 October, but she was "the only U State ship of war ... which has appeared at all on this coast since October until the arrival of the *Boston*"
        - *Philadelphia* spent the winter in Syracuse
        - [USS *Essex*]() stationed off Gibraltar
        - "This is a singularly economical mode of carrying on the war; and it is not extraordinary, if Gentlemen *feelingly* attached to it should take offence at a vigilance which should go to put an end to it" (BW2:166-67)
    - Eaton also feels that when he declared the blockade, the navy did not act decisively enough at that time and thus lost the opportunity for a swift resolution.
    - He reserves particular fury for [Alexander Murray](), suggesting that in his public reproval of the *Gloria* affair, he acted more like a Barbary ruler than like an American: "Had he possessed the delicacy due from one officer of the government to another, and sent my ship back to me with his opinion modestly expressed, I should have been reconciled to the manner, though not to the measure of his conduct; but to proclaim in the Consulate of the U States, at that place, my reprehensibility - to forbid the Consul furnishing the ship any Supplies - and to endeavor to take the seamen out of her as he really did two of them in his own barge (as if prepensel bent to distress me) are transactions at which a man of less sensibilty than myself could not but be moved"
        - He further avers that Murray never told him of his disapproval while they were actually together but just gave instructions to Captain Bounds as if Eaton were not there
        - Murray claimed that he could not take [Hamet Karamanli]() out of a neutral vessel; Eaton claimed that he was interpreting the Law of Nations incorrectly (see [International law]())
    - "I do not undertake to say that the commanders have not acted in conformity to orders - But I cannot forbear repeating, what I have so often insisted on, and what I fear we shall find true too late; Except more energy be thrown into our operations against Tripoli, we shall fail in our object; and, by a temporizing mode of warfare, encourage the other Barbary powers to become insolent This will not be found the prediction of a disordered fancy! All the frigates of the U States employed in cruising, or even in a blockade, are inadequate to prevent the small gallies of the enemy from stealing out and doing us mischief."
    - Eaton claims that the Swedish admiral is on board with his plan for [Hamet Karamanli](): "How is it that every Commander, as well as every body else who has acted on this coast comes into this measure; and that those only who have scarcely or never been here take on themselves to reject it!" (BW2:170) 
- Eaton laments that as he has refused to take bribes from any Barbary ruler, he has been holding the moral high ground, but "The postures I have taken and held here, since the war, have kept me in continual perplexity and embarrassment. Why? I have been badly supported - or rather not supported at all - It is to be hoped this will not always be the case - National Honor, interest, economy dictate otherwise - Gentlemen late in command say I am too fast - Capt Murray likewise. Perhaps it is because they are too slow." (BW2:228, 7 August 1802) 
- Eaton further excoriates [Alexander Murray]() to SecState: "Whatever may be Cap. Murray's opinion of my measures, he ought not to sacrifice the interest of service to individual resentments. Government may as well send out *quaker meeting-houses* to float about this sea as frigates with Murrays in command." (BW2:229, 9 August 1802) 
- Eaton has better feelings toward [Daniel McNeill](), of whose rogue conduct he apparently approves, despite their risk: sad that he was sent home for, in part, "adopting measures which he believed, and which would have been if supported, useful to the interests of the United States" (BW2:229, 9 August 1802)
- Murray seems to try to smooth things over with Eaton, writing that "I assure you I respect your zeal in your unwearied effort to serve our Country & am willing to believe that you have had a wrong representation of that business from your Captain, or you never coud have express'd your warmth in such a manner, but a truce to this disagreeable subject" (BW2:238, 18 August 1802)
- [George Coffin]() and [Charles Wadsworth]() write a letter (to whom not certain) averring that they were consulted by Eaton about the *Gloria* plan and agreed with him that the *Gloria* should be taken into public service for the use of Eaton while he worked with [Hamet Karamanli]() (BW2:247-48, 22 August 1802)
- [James Leander Cathcart]() weighs in on the battle between Murray and Eaton: "Capt Alexr Murray arrogated to himself the presumption to discard measures the motives of which whether *right* or *wrong* he must have been perfectly unacquainted with, na totally ignorant off, & which exclusive of his being a junior officer to Capt McNiel, were by no means in his department, & that too in a stile of the most illiberal censure, without even observing the common respect due from public Officers in difft departments to each other especially in foreign ports" (BW2:253)
    - "the President will ge pleas'd to draw a line of distinction between the relative dutys of the Consuls residing in Barbary & the Commanders of our vessels of War, for I cant suppose it conductive to the public interests to subject men (who have spent the best parts of their lives in the public service & who have been several years acquiring knowledge in the Country's where they reside) to the caprice of every gentleman who may command our vessels of War, for altho they may be excellent seamen & as good officers it must be supposed that they must be very deficient in any superficial knowledge they may have acquired relative to Barbary where they have scarce ever been, & even had their stay been proportioned to the full extent of their penetration & wisdom, from their want of Knowledge of the language & manners & customs of the people, they would be able to obtain but little information but what would derive from the Consul resident, whose measures if they in the plenitude of their power think proper to discard & censure, I presume we had much better stay at home than subject ourselves to this additional degradation"
    -  "The situation of a Consul in Barbary provided he is determined to do his duty is of all others the most humiliating & perilous, exiled ('tho honorably) from his dearest connections, doom'd to breath an air contaminated by plague & slavery, subject even in our beds to the mortal stings of scorpions, exposed to every species of insolence & degradation that a fertile brain'd Mohammetan can invent to render the life of a christian superlatively miserable, that dare oppose his will, one moment menaced with chains, the next with death & damnation, in a state of constant vigilance concern & perplexity; their is no occasion nor necessity in addition to a11 our suffering of subjecting our measures to the control of men, who from the routine of their duty can have as little ability to judge either of their pro- priety or utility as they have had modesty in censureing what they wanted the power to condemn"
    -   "if this act is sanctioned by government it will in future be quoted as precedent, which would be giving our Commanders a latitude productive of many irregularities especially in so young a Navy as ours, & would likewise be the means of engendaring animossity's where the greatest unanimity & most cordial concurence ought to exist"

# Balance of powers
- BW2:244: SecState writes to [James Leander Cathcart](): "To provide for any contingency to yourself, which might produce disappointment or delay, Commodore Morris will be instructed, should the negotiation not be over, to carry it on himself if necessary;and as he will be in a manner the centre of information, and will have a certain relation to all the measures connected with our Mediterranean &airs, the President thinks it proper, that the proceedings which may remain for the fulfillment of your instructions, should be concerted with him and receive his sanction," 22 August 1802 -- This is not how it had gone previous to this point; the diplomats and commodore worked toward the same goal but not necessarily with the same tactics or the same zeal

# Differences of opinion
- BW2:288: [James Leander Cathcart]() notes that [Alexander Murray]() has a significantly different perspective on how to approach the Barbary problem than he has; " as he says he has no instructions either from government or the Comodore & I not yet having receiv'd mine which came out in the *Adams* I have made no opposition to what he advances in order to prevent as much as possible those little bickerings & animosities which are too often engender'd by diversity of opinion, I am extremely anxious to receive my instructions in order to have some guide to regulate my conduct by where such diversity of opinion prevails" (8 October 1802)
