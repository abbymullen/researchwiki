Most of the time, it seems that the naval officers and the Mediterranean diplomats, if not completely in sync with each other, at least didn't get in each others' way. Sometimes they directly clashed, though.

- BW2:145: [Alexander Murray]() takes [William Eaton]() to task for hiring the *Gloria* "on Public account" and tells him that he has dismissed the *Gloria* from public service, 6 May 1802: "However unpleasant a circumstance it is to disapprove of any measures which you have adopted & which I beleive you have deemed expedient, in your Zeal to serve our Country, yet as an Officer in the U. States service my Duty compels me to check all unwarrantable expences"
    - Not everyone agrees with Murray's perspective: Purser [Charles Wadsworth]() of the [USS *Boston*]() says that he thinks sending the *Gloria* to Gibraltar was the right idea, 20 May 1802 (BW2:161)
- BW2:146: [Alexander Murray]() does not have a high opinion of the diplomats; he writes to SecNav: " there are at this time a Squadron of Sweedish Frigates on that Coast [of Tripoli], so that we have but little to fear from any of the Barbary, States, tho our Consuls make a great fuss about nothing"
- [William Eaton]()'s plan for [Hamet Karamanli]() is not popular amongst the navy; he records that [Samuel Barron](), [William Bainbridge](), and [Alexander Murray]() offer "very severe criticism" of the plan (8 June 1802, BW2:166)
