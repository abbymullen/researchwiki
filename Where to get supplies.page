One of the constant questions for the squadron was whether to get supplies from America or buy them from places in the Mediterranean. Eventually the squadron adopted a hybrid policy on this question.

- BW2:319: [Alexander Murray]() suggests less supplies from America and more in the Med: "I must beg leave to observe to you that I think it woud be a great saving to the Government, if instead of incumbering our Ships with such large quantities of Bread, which takes up so much room that a due proportion of Flour might be sent over & above three Months store for present use, we can have the Flour landed here or at Malta & get good fresh Bread Baked out of it at little expence & no waste, consequently more salt Provisions might be taken on board, & less Water than usual so that each Ship coud carry at least eight Months Provisions, & Stores, for the having of extra stores deposited at Gibralter, is little better than having them in America, so very precarious, & uncertain are our passages up & down the Mediterranean, for an extent of near 1500 Miles to the Coast of Tripoli" (21 November 1802)

    - BW1:596: [Richard Dale]() asks the governor of Algeciras to release the *American Packet* to him so he can make the [USS President]() ready for sea, reminding him that Dale had previously told the governor that this store ship was coming, and also asking for assistance in watering the President
    - BW1:606: Dale is not pleased with the quality of supplies in the ship: "I cannot say what is the reason there was no Butter, Cheese, Rum, Mollasses, or Candles sent out in the store ship. - the Bread that was sent is full of weevil."
