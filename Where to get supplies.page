One of the constant questions for the squadron was whether to get supplies from America or buy them from places in the Mediterranean. Eventually the squadron adopted a hybrid policy on this question.

## From America
- BW1:548: *American Packet* dispatched from Washington DC to Gibraltar with supplies for squadron, 14 August 1801


## In the Mediterranean
- BW1:553: [Richard Dale]() discovers that Malta has only water, no stores, so he recommends Syracuse as a place to get supplies
- BW1:569: [William Bainbridge]() calls at both Malaga and Gibraltar for supplies, but he is unable to get anything but bread and meat--no preserved food (2 September 1801)
    - BW1:570: Bainbridge goes to Algeciras to get supplies but is told by [Samuel Barron]() of the [USS *Philadelphia*]() that he should go to Tangier; when weather prevented entering Tangier, they went to Tetuan instead
- BW1:587: [Daniel McNeill]() ordered to take minister to a French port, possibly Havre or L'Orient, and get water, bread, and spirits there, Oct. 1, 1801
