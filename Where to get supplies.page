One of the constant questions for the squadron was whether to get supplies from America or buy them from places in the Mediterranean. Eventually the squadron adopted a hybrid policy on this question.

## From America
- BW1:548: *American Packet* dispatched from Washington DC to Gibraltar with supplies for squadron, 14 August 1801


## In the Mediterranean
- BW1:553: [Richard Dale]() discovers that Malta has only water, no stores, so he recommends Syracuse as a place to get supplies
