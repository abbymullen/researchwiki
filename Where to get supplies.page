One of the constant questions for the squadron was whether to get supplies from America or buy them from places in the Mediterranean. Eventually the squadron adopted a hybrid policy on this question.

## From America
- BW1:548: *American Packet* dispatched from Washington DC to Gibraltar with supplies for squadron, 14 August 1801
    - BW1:594-95: *American Packet* captured by Spanish privateers and brought to Algeciras, 5 October 1801; she turns out to have been carrying some private cargo as well (which was a violation of the blockade? [Richard Dale]() seems to think this was a problem and an ethical violation; not quite sure why).
    - BW1:596: [Richard Dale]() asks the governor of Algeciras to release the *American Packet* to him so he can make the [USS President]() ready for sea, reminding him that Dale had previously told the governor that this store ship was coming, and also asking for assistance in watering the President
    - BW1:606: Dale is not pleased with the quality of supplies in the ship: "I cannot say what is the reason there was no Butter, Cheese, Rum, Mollasses, or Candles sent out in the store ship. - the Bread that was sent is full of weevil." 


## In the Mediterranean
- BW1:553: [Richard Dale]() discovers that Malta has only water, no stores, so he recommends Syracuse as a place to get supplies
- BW1:569: [William Bainbridge]() calls at both Malaga and Gibraltar for supplies, but he is unable to get anything but bread and meat--no preserved food (2 September 1801)
    - BW1:570: Bainbridge goes to Algeciras to get supplies but is told by [Samuel Barron]() of the [USS *Philadelphia*]() that he should go to Tangier; when weather prevented entering Tangier, they went to Tetuan instead
- BW1:587: [Daniel McNeill]() ordered to take minister to a French port, possibly Havre or L'Orient, and get water, bread, and spirits there, Oct. 1, 1801
- BW1:591: [Richard Dale](): "my Provisions being nearly Expended I proceeded for this place [Gibraltar](), Expecting to find a store ship, from America with stores, I am sorry to say, that I am disappointed I shall wait a few days, if she dos not arrive in that time, I can get supplyed with what I want from His Majestys Magazines, this Garrison is very Friendly and attentive to the Squadron," 1 October 1801
- BW1:595: [Richard Dale]() calls on the dockmaster at Gibraltar to honor the agreement issed by the king and asks for a new foresail fore and a new main topsail, 5 October 1801 (they oblige on Oct 7, BW1:596)
- BW1:603: Dale instructs [Samuel Barron]() that Syracuse is a good place to get supplies, "you may get every supply that you may want in the, Eating way, and that very cheap," 25 October 1801
- BW1:612: Dale expresses concern about overcharging? at Gibraltar but seems to indicate that the problem has been corrected with no fuss, 30 October 1801.
- BW1:640: At the end of cruise 1, the store ship *James* takes stores from the USA to the Mediterranean, but the homeward bound ships have to deposit any extra stores with [John Gavino]() at Gibraltar to disperse amongst the ships that are staying (15 December 1801) 
- BW1:644: [USS *Essex*]() gets vegetables from shore at Algeciras, 21 December 1801
- BW2:24: [Richard Dale]() suggests that the [USS *Philadelphia*]() stop for supplies at Leghorn before coming back to the USA, 18 January 1802
- BW2:26 Dale says that [Daniel McNeill]() should be able to get supplies from the British agent (uncertain at what port), 18 January 1802
- BW2:59: [USS *Essex*]() takes on at Gibraltar, 9 February 1802:
    - Forty Barrels of Beef
    - Thirty five barrels of Pork
    - Fifteen Barrels of Flour
    - One hundred and Seventy Barrels of bread
    - Twenty five Bags of Peas
    - One Tierce of Rice
