One of the constant questions for the squadron was whether to get supplies from America or buy them from places in the Mediterranean. Eventually the squadron adopted a hybrid policy on this question.

## From America
- BW1:548: *American Packet* dispatched from Washington DC to Gibraltar with supplies for squadron, 14 August 1801
    - BW1:594-95: *American Packet* captured by Spanish privateers and brought to Algeciras, 5 October 1801; she turns out to have been carrying some private cargo as well (which was a violation of the blockade? [Richard Dale]() seems to think this was a problem and an ethical violation; not quite sure why).


## In the Mediterranean
- BW1:553: [Richard Dale]() discovers that Malta has only water, no stores, so he recommends Syracuse as a place to get supplies
- BW1:569: [William Bainbridge]() calls at both Malaga and Gibraltar for supplies, but he is unable to get anything but bread and meat--no preserved food (2 September 1801)
    - BW1:570: Bainbridge goes to Algeciras to get supplies but is told by [Samuel Barron]() of the [USS *Philadelphia*]() that he should go to Tangier; when weather prevented entering Tangier, they went to Tetuan instead
- BW1:587: [Daniel McNeill]() ordered to take minister to a French port, possibly Havre or L'Orient, and get water, bread, and spirits there, Oct. 1, 1801
- BW1:591: [Richard Dale](): "my Provisions being nearly Expended I proceeded for this place [Gibraltar](), Expecting to find a store ship, from America with stores, I am sorry to say, that I am disappointed I shall wait a few days, if she dos not arrive in that time, I can get supplyed with what I want from His Majestys Magazines, this Garrison is very Friendly and attentive to the Squadron," 1 October 1801
- BW1:595: [Richard Dale]() calls on the dockmaster at Gibraltar to honor the agreement issed by the king and asks for a new foresail fore and a new main topsail, 5 October 1801 (they oblige on Oct 7, BW1:596)
