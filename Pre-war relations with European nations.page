Leading a newly formed nation, with no military to speak of and no way to protect commerce, the American government was sensitive to how the nation was perceived in the European community, since friendly ties to Europe were vital to the success of America's commerce. 

In the 1780s and 1790s, several different perspectives emerged about how the United States related to Europe.

## Conspiracy against America
- BW1:2: [Richard O'Brien]() to [Thomas Jefferson](), 8 June 1786: "It is not the interest of any commercial nation that the Americans should obtain a peace with the Barbary States, whilst they reap such benefits in being the carriers of our commerce, particularly the English, French & Spanish being jealous of us."

- BW1:43: [Edward Church]() to Sec of State, 22 September 1793: "Col Humphries (from whom I recd the information) has doubtless aquainted you, that England & Spain seem to be plotting in what way they can most effectually clip our Eagle's Wings, They are both extremely envious of her soaring."

- BW1:48: [Edward Church]() to Sec of State, 12 October 1793, in re: Portuguese treaty with Algiers: "The Conduct of the british in this business leaves no room to doubt, or mistake their object, which was evidently aimed at Us, and proves that their envy, jealousy, and hatred, will never be appeased, and that they will leave nothing unattempted to effect our ruin, - as a farther confirmation it is worthy of remark, that the same british Agent obtained a Truce at the same time between the States of Holland and the Dey, for Six Months, whereby We and the Eanse towns are now left the only prey to those Barbarians. . . . I have reason to fear that there is an infernal combination in Europe against Us, France excepted, - and that we have no other hope or resource but in our own Strength."

- BW1:207: Joel Barlow to Secretary of State, 18 August 1797: Further speculation about a European conspiracy to force USA out of the Mediterranean because of their success in dealing with Barbary

### Britain as instigator of hostility
- BW1:2: [Richard O'Brien]() to [Thomas Jefferson](), 8 June 1786: "I have reason to suspect that the Dey had a hint conveyed to him by the British Consul, who you may be assured is an inveterate enemy to the Americans."

- BW1:66: Nathaniel Cutting to Sec of State, 10 February 1793: "I am fully of opinion that the English Government has been the principal and primary cause that our mission to Algiers has proved abortive. The Portugueze Cabinet of itself has had but little hand in bringing about the melancholly catastrophe which has added so greatly to the number of our suffering Citizens - to the actual loss of property as well as to the general injury of our Trade."

- BW1:565: [William Eaton]() outright accuses [Bryan McDonogh]() of conspiring to attack the American squadron, in violation of British treaties withe the USA, 1 September 1801

- BW1:572: [Bryan McDonogh]() also castigated by [James Leander Cathcart](): "a person that would be guilty of such an act of Treason to his own Nation in consequence of a pecuniary reward, certainly would not hesitate to injure ours in hopes of ingraciating himself with our enemies, & thereby reaping a benefit, his venality is well Known by every Consul at Tripoli"

### Motives for uncharitable behavior
- BW1:67: Nathaniel Cutting to Sec of State, 10 February 1793: "The grand principle that has hirtherto opperated upon all the maritime Powers of Europe in this business, appear to me to be not so much the offspring of fear and avarice, as of jealousy & envy. - A miserable spirit of illiberality has induced them to practice all the infamous arts of finesse rather than openly and steadily to pursue a gallant warfare against those petty villains who wantonly infringe the rights, and impede the social intercourse between different members, of "the great family of mankind"."
- BW1:149: Joel Barlow to Secretary of State, 20 April 1796: "Louis XIV said if there was no Algiers he would build one; as it would be the cheapest way of depriving the Italian States of their natural right of navigating their own seas; a policy doubtless unworthy of us, and only fit for a king. But as long as the Powers of Europe will persist in this policy,.whether we will or not, we must either be its victims or partake of its advantages."

## France: friendship turns hostile
- BW1:98: David Humphreys to Joseph Donaldson Jr., 18 May 1795: "Consul of France, who has on a former occasion offered us his friendly assistance & who is now most earnestly solicited to use his best influence in favour of our negotiations with the Dey & Regency"...(BW1:99)"As you will perceive, from what has already been intimated, that we have great reason to expect the friendly and efficacious co-operation of the French Republic in our Barbary negotiations, & particularly with those States, where we have not hitherto had Treaties established; you will be pleased to keep this expectation constantly in mind, and act entirely with the privity & concert of the Agents or Consuls of that Republic accordingly."

- BW1:197-98: Joseph Ingraham to Joel Barlow, 4 March 1797: In Tripoli, Ingraham invites all the European consuls to dinner at the Spanish consul's house, but French consul refuses to come because of tensions and breakoff of communications re:trade elsewhere. (Quasi-War affects European relations in Barbary.)

- BW1:199-200: Joel Barlow to U.S. Minister in Paris, 14 March 1797: Further evidence of French interruption of American trade in Med (read in its entirety)

## Scandinavian countries: generally friendly
- BW1:273: Secretary of State to James Leander Cathcart, 20 December 1798: "You know the opposing interests of the European nations in regard to the Barbary states, and thence how little the sincere aid of their Consuls is to be relied on: yet you know that we experienced the friendship of the Swedes at Algiers, and the Spanis[h] Consul, Gerardo Joseph de Souza at Tripoli, has manifested by his acts such good will to the United States as to merit the warmest acknowledgements from the Government."
- BW1:364: Sec of State to [John Quincy Adams](), 24 July 1800: minister of Sweden suggests military alliance between Denmark, Sweden, and USA for purposes of protecting commerce; president unwilling to make such an alliance while USA is not officially at war in Barbary

## Need to work with Europe
- BW1:10: John Adams to Thomas Jefferson, 11 July 1786, "1. Justice is in favor of this opinion. 2. Honor favors it. 3. It will procure us respect in Europe; and respect is a safeguard to interest."
- BW1:272: Secretary of State to William Eaton, 20 December 1798: "It is to be remembered that as the policy of the Barbary Powers constantly leads them to make war on some of the christian nations, so the agents of these nations respectively endeavour to ward of[f] the mischief; and thus are, in some sort, in a state of hostility among themselves. Whenever therefore the interests of the United States are in question, you must chiefly rely on your own means to secure them. Among the foreign Consuls, however, there may be some whom your experience of their candour may authorize you to confide in; and by a friendly intercourse and mutual assistance the common interests of the several nations you and they represent may be advanced. While with such you will cultivate an acquaintance, you will endeavour to live on terms of civility and good neighbourhood with all."
