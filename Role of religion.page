## Using religion as ulterior motive
- BW1:3: [Richard O'Brien]() to [Thomas Jefferson](), 8 June 1786: "it is the policy of Christian nations to keep those nations of Turks & Moors at war with other Christian Nations. and the people in general here wish for a war with those nations in the streights, for I am sure that nothing but so great a sum as the Spaniards are to give would reconcile those people to the Spaniards, they having such an inveteracy against them for persecuting the Mahometan religion - but money is the God of Algiers & Mahomet their prophet."
- BW2:105: The bey of Tunis ostensibly declines to allow American ships to reprovision at Tunis because it is "a Violation of the laws of the Profet to provision the enemy of a Mahometan"; [William Eaton]() avers that it's actually because he refused to grant passports to the Tunisian vessels to go to Tripoli.
- BW2:111: [James Leander Cathcart]() writes to [William Eaton]() with advice about how to handle Hamet Karamanli: "this you had better inculcate on the mind of Hamed Bashaw, inform bun that the five fingers of the immortal Allah! is directed against his brother & will never cease to persecute him until the sin of fratercide is entirely wiped away from the Caramanli family by the punishment of the Agressor, give him to understand that it was predestined by God & foretold in Tripoli by the great hereditary Maraboot (i e, Saint) Ciddi Mohammet Bograra that he should be xe deliverer of his Country, which was the real cause that said Bograra was murder'd by the reigning Bashaw, explain to him the improbability of a nation so remote from Tripoli as America is sending a Naval force to espouse his cause unless influenced by an Omnipotent decree, no doubt by the intercession of the great Phrophet (or Jupiter thunderer if you please) & if you have George Sales Koran, a person who is so good a theologist as you are, will be at no greater loss to find a parable or sentence applictt-ble to any meaning than our fanaticks at home have been to find argument to support the preposterous idea that the three white horses which were rode by Generals Washington Buonaparte & Abercromby were the identical Animals described in the Revelations In short my dear sir work upon their passions, make use of their absurdities & superstitions as lawful weapons" (10 April 1802) 
- BW2:485: SecState to [Tobias Lear](): "The universal toleration in matters of religion in most of our States, and the entire want of power respecting them in the general Government, has as we understand induced the Barbary powers, to view us more favorably than other Christian Nations who are exclusively so, and with whom these powers consider themselves in perpetual hostility, suspended only at times, by temporary truces. It is recommended to you to avail us of this fact & opinion, as far as it can be used to lessen the unequal condition of the intercourse between us" (14 July 1803) 

## Use of terminology
- "Christian" appears to be simply a designation for non-Barbary --- "Christian nations," etc., with more of a broad cultural connection than a specifically religious one

## Religious proof-texting for diplomacy's sake
- BW1:350: [Richard O'Brien](), 13 March 1800: "The Swede dean and American Consuls agreed to give as a present. to the head Turkish Priest or Bishop of Algiers To The amount of 1200 dollars a t the rate of 400 dollars each of The 3 Consuls. for the Bishop to find out a part of The Koran which required Musselmen not to persicute Christians at peace with them. This was to cleare The Spanish Consul of Chains and to give Security to ourselves on the like Occasions."
