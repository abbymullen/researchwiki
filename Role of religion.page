## Using religion as ulterior motive
- BW1:3: [Richard O'Brien]() to [Thomas Jefferson](), 8 June 1786: "it is the policy of Christian nations to keep those nations of Turks & Moors at war with other Christian Nations. and the people in general here wish for a war with those nations in the streights, for I am sure that nothing but so great a sum as the Spaniards are to give would reconcile those people to the Spaniards, they having such an inveteracy against them for persecuting the Mahometan religion - but money is the God of Algiers & Mahomet their prophet."

## Use of terminology
- "Christian" appears to be simply a designation for non-Barbary --- "Christian nations," etc., with more of a broad cultural connection than a specifically religious one
