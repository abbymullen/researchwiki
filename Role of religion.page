## Using religion as ulterior motive
- BW1:3: [Richard O'Brien]() to [Thomas Jefferson](), 8 June 1786: "it is the policy of Christian nations to keep those nations of Turks & Moors at war with other Christian Nations. and the people in general here wish for a war with those nations in the streights, for I am sure that nothing but so great a sum as the Spaniards are to give would reconcile those people to the Spaniards, they having such an inveteracy against them for persecuting the Mahometan religion - but money is the God of Algiers & Mahomet their prophet."
- BW2:105: The bey of Tunis ostensibly declines to allow American ships to reprovision at Tunis because it is "a Violation of the laws of the Profet to provision the enemy of a Mahometan"; [William Eaton]() avers that it's actually because he refused to grant passports to the Tunisian vessels to go to Tripoli.

## Use of terminology
- "Christian" appears to be simply a designation for non-Barbary --- "Christian nations," etc., with more of a broad cultural connection than a specifically religious one

## Religious proof-texting for diplomacy's sake
- BW1:350: [Richard O'Brien](), 13 March 1800: "The Swede dean and American Consuls agreed to give as a present. to the head Turkish Priest or Bishop of Algiers To The amount of 1200 dollars a t the rate of 400 dollars each of The 3 Consuls. for the Bishop to find out a part of The Koran which required Musselmen not to persicute Christians at peace with them. This was to cleare The Spanish Consul of Chains and to give Security to ourselves on the like Occasions."
