- Secretary of the Navy cautions naval vessels against breaking jurisdiction: " You are to refrain from exercising the powers of capturing or recapturing in waters within the Jurisdictional limits and under the protection of any other nation, in order that their peace & sovereignty may remain unviolated, and we shall scrupulously and without indulgence examine that conduct which shall bring us into collision with any other power" (BW2:60, 18 February 1802)
- [James Simpson]() invokes the law of nations when denying the request of the emperor of Morocco to allow his ships of wheat to go to Tripoli (BW2:165), around 1 June 1802
- When the United States takes a Yerban ship bound for Tripoli, the bey of Tunis is very grumpy about it. [William Eaton]() tells him that the ship should have known of the blockade and of the Americans' right to detain any ships going into Tripoli. "If, in contempt of this advice and caution, they chuse to risk their property, and it falls into our hands, it becomes, of course, good prize, by a right founded on the known and received laws of nations, applicable in such cases.'[The bey replies:] 'We Barbary States, do not admit the laws of war, established among Christian nations, applicable to us." (BW2:345, 26 January 1803) 
    - Eaton complains against the vagaries of Barbary law: "If the Barbary Regencies have customs or maxims of war peculiar to themselves, and distinct from the general and acknoledged laws of other belligerent powers, this is no reason why we should renounce the latter, and conform ourselves to the former, which indeed, are neither specified nor known, and dictated chiefly by the circumstances of the moment; even though we may find precedent for such a concession."
    - *Contrast or continuity with national laws?* Eaton continues: "It is incumbent on me at the same time to signify to you, that though I am not informed what may be the discretionary power of the Commodore in like cases, I doubt whether he be authorized to render this cargo to your claim; because, it being admitted that it was destined for Tripoli, and it being known that this port was in a state of blockade, it has become good prize to the captors, the property totally alienated from the shippers, and subject to the disposition of our laws. No decision therefore can be had in favor of the claimants without the interference of the government of the United States. But, should they consent to grant an indemnity in this case it would be an act of special favor, not of right. I hope your excellency will allow me sufficient time to submit the necessary statement to the President, my master, and wait his decision"
