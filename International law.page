- Secretary of the Navy cautions naval vessels against breaking jurisdiction: " You are to refrain from exercising the powers of capturing or recapturing in waters within the Jurisdictional limits and under the protection of any other nation, in order that their peace & sovereignty may remain unviolated, and we shall scrupulously and without indulgence examine that conduct which shall bring us into collision with any other power" (BW2:60, 18 February 1802)
