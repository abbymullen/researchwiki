Naval officers often gave clues about how they perceived their enemies and even their allies in the Mediterranean. Specific people were singled out, but often the comments of the officers encompassed entire groups.

# Barbary 
- BW2:495: Reaction of American sailors to a Tunisian vessel that they brought to: "had she been a Tripoline she would have been prize for the Men were all hot for Battle, friends or Foes. - The sight of a Turban soon enrages them" (22 July 1803) 

## Cowardly
- [John R. Fenwick](), 3 February 1802: "none of our Vessels as yet have been taken, & whilst the Dread of the Americans exists, the pusillanimity of these people will prevent them leaving their Ports" (BW2:47)
- [Henry Wadsworth]() implies that the people of Tripoli are cowardly in their response to the [USS *John Adams*]() firing a broadside into the town: "These shot went thro' the Bashaw's Palace, his favorite wife fainted all was confusion in the
City -running to & fro: The next day, when the J. Adams stood in for the City again - it cost the Bey several hundreds of dollars to hiremen to man the guns his own soldiers refusing" (7 June 1803, BW2:446)

## Polite
- [William Bainbridge]() comments that the governor of Tangier received them "with civility & a degree of Moorish politeness" (BW2:65, 25 February 1802)

## Deceitful
- [Hugh G. Campbell]() writes to [William Burrows](): "Be assured Sir, they [specifically the Moroccans] are Slippery Politicians, & require good Looking after Either in peace or war" (BW2:335, 16 December 1802)
- [James Simpson]() writes of [Alcayde Hashash]() of Morocco: "I confess I cannot have full reliance on all that Man says, as by subterfuge it is not uncommon with him to evade declaring facts" (BW3:19, 5 September 1803) 

# Europeans
- [Alexander Murray]() sees Europeans as cowardly and selfish: " Why will the narrow & selfish policy of European nations suffer those Piratical powers thus to usurp the dominion of this Sea? Ought they not rather to be put under the Ban of all civilization? Was there a chance of making war with them, upon such terms as not to effect the liberty of those, who fall into their hands, & to exchange man for man, some excuse might be alledged, but on the present form of warfare, all nations ought to cry aloud against them." (BW2:155, 18 May 1802)
- [Henry Wadsworth]() notes the interest the people of Naples have in the [Meshouda](): "a Tripoline vessel, which to them is a rare sight, for in their wars with the Barbarians they have shewn themselves such infamous cowards, that a capture on their part rarely occurs" (30 July 1803, BW2:502)
