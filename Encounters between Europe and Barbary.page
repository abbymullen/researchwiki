### Portugal and Algiers
- 16 May 1802: An Algerian 44-gun frigate captured a 44-gun Portuguese frigate, killing 72 Portuguese crew; Portuguese frigate captured with little enough damage that it would be incorporated into the Algerian fleet (BW2:155-56)

## Sweden and Tripoli
- BW2:189: The treaty that Col. Tornquist negotiated with Tripoli has apparently fallen through; Sweden intends to send another squadron against Tripoli once it has settled with Great Britain (2 July 1802)

## France and Algiers
- BW2:195: [James McKnight]() reports that the French have landed 20,000 men at Oran near Algiers, with another 30,000 on their way, to attack Algiers (seems unlikely?), 8 July 1802
- Coller: "Evidence of close personal connection between the dey and individuals within the French government recurs at other points through the revolutionary period and suggests far more frequent traffic across the Mediterranean than most historians have imagined." (Coller 69)


## Diplomacy between Europe and Barbary
- "However, as Panzac has argued, an overemphasis on piratical warfare— the “Barbary legend”— can mask the “multiple but unequal relations” between Europe and the Maghreb.20 Magali Morsy suggests that by the late eighteenth century corsair activities had become a key element of politics, a way of maintaining diplomatic relations against stronger powers, and “a useful and indeed necessary way of upholding trade.”21 Throughout the late eighteenth century North African states were turning from the sea toward the land. The revolutionary wars shifted this course dramatically: maritime warfare and diplomacy went global." --IAN COLLER, “Barbary and Revolution: France and North Africa, 1789-1798,” in French Mediterraneans, Transnational and Imperial Histories (University of Nebraska Press, 2016), 59, http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d8h8t4.7.
