Accidents to ships or people were no small matter when the squadron was deployed in unfamiliar and sometimes hostile territory. When accidents occurred, they depleted the squadron's strength, caused diplomatic delays, and strained relations with friendly (or not-so-friendly) nations.

### To ships
- 7 December 1801: [USS President]() runs into a rock at Port Mahon; [Richard Dale]()'s assessment: "It is out of my power at present to say how long I shall remain here, therefore cannot say when you may expect to see me" (BW1:629)
- [Stephen Cathalan]() reports that the best place in the Mediterranean to get ship repairs done is Toulon: "there all kinds of Conveniences are to be found" (BW2:87)
- [USS *Essex*]() becomes fouled with a Portuguese vessel in Gibraltar harbor when the Portuguese vessel anchors too close to the *Essex*, 17 April 1802---no permanent injury (BW2:126)
    - The next day, the Portuguese frigate again becomes fouled with the *Essex*, so [William Bainbridge]() sent a message to the commodore of the Portuguese squadron to ask him to send on board that vessel someone who was competent to unfoul them; it took them the entire day to get extricated from the Portuguese vessel and its attendant cables and anchors (BW2:129)
- [USS *Constellation*]() loses two anchors before it even leaves America; [Alexander Murray]() requests that [William Kirkpatrick]() in Malaga supply them or help him get them in Cartagena, 30 April 1802 (BW2:140)
    - Ends up at Gibraltar, where he requests them of [Lord Keith](), 5 May 1802 (BW2:144)
- [USS *Boston*]() springs a bowsprit while cruising off Tripoli and goes to Messina to get it repaired, 4 May 1802 (BW2:143)
- [USS *Chesapeake*]() sprung their mainmast 4 days out from America; [Richard Valentine Morris]() records that it was rotten all the way around, 3 inches in, from the hounds to the berth deck. He has had to request a new mast from [Lord Keith]() at Gibraltar (BW2:162, 31 May 1802)
    - Worth noting that Morris is generally unhappy with the condition and trim of the *Chesapeake*
- [USS *Adams*]() reports a rotten mizzenmast upon arrival in the Med, as well as a cable damaged from poor anchorages (BW2:268, 7 September 1802)

### To persons
- A strange little episode: 2 midshipmen from the [USS *Essex*]() went on shore, where it seems that they dueled with each other, and Mr. Higginbotham killed Mr. Swartwout. Uncertain whether this occurred in Gibraltar or Algeciras. Higginbotham was arrested, and permission to bury Swartwout in Gibraltar was denied. (BW2:96, 27 March 1802) Swartwout was ultimately buried in Algeciras, Fort St. Iago, 28 March 1802 (BW2:97).
- BW2:203: [USS *Essex*](), 14 July 1802, records a storm that carried away “Main top mast, main & fore top gallt yards & split Main top gallt mast. Jno Bradley & Jno Weyant seamen went overboard with the rigging & were lost.” (See also [Weather]().)
