Accidents to ships or people were no small matter when the squadron was deployed in unfamiliar and sometimes hostile territory. When accidents occurred, they depleted the squadron's strength, caused diplomatic delays, and strained relations with friendly (or not-so-friendly) nations.

### To ships
- 7 December 1801: [USS President]() runs into a rock at Port Mahon; [Richard Dale]()'s assessment: "It is out of my power at present to say how long I shall remain here, therefore cannot say when you may expect to see me" (BW1:629)
- [Stephen Cathalan]() reports that the best place in the Mediterranean to get ship repairs done is Toulon: "there all kinds of Conveniences are to be found" (BW2:87)
- [USS *Essex*]() becomes fouled with a Portuguese vessel in Gibraltar harbor when the Portuguese vessel anchors too close to the *Essex*, 17 April 1802---no permanent injury (BW2:126)
    - The next day, the Portuguese frigate again becomes fouled with the *Essex*, so [William Bainbridge]() sent a message to the commodore of the Portuguese squadron to ask him to send on board that vessel someone who was competent to unfoul them; it took them the entire day to get extricated from the Portuguese vessel and its attendant cables and anchors (BW2:129)
- [USS *Constellation*]() loses two anchors before it even leaves America; [Alexander Murray]() requests that [William Kirkpatrick]() in Malaga supply them or help him get them in Cartagena, 30 April 1802 (BW2:140)
    - Ends up at Gibraltar, where he requests them of [Lord Keith](), 5 May 1802 (BW2:144)
- [USS *Boston*]() springs a bowsprit while cruising off Tripoli and goes to Messina to get it repaired, 4 May 1802 (BW2:143)
- [USS *Chesapeake*]() sprung their mainmast 4 days out from America; [Richard Valentine Morris]() records that it was rotten all the way around, 3 inches in, from the hounds to the berth deck. He has had to request a new mast from [Lord Keith]() at Gibraltar (BW2:162, 31 May 1802)
    - Worth noting that Morris is generally unhappy with the condition and trim of the *Chesapeake*
- [USS *Adams*]() reports a rotten mizzenmast upon arrival in the Med, as well as a cable damaged from poor anchorages (BW2:268, 7 September 1802)
- [USS *New York*]() lost several sails and masts before even leaving the USA (BW2:270, 8 September 1802)
- [USS *Constellation*]() breaks a pintle of its rudder, requiring the rudder to be unhung and the part to be replaced (around 10 days of repair time?), (BW2:277, 18 September 1802)
- [USS *Constellation*]() springs its foremast and foreyard on its way from Toulon to Gibraltar (BW2:316, 19 November 1802)
    - Constellation puts in at Malaga to get repairs. [Alexander Murray]() thinks Malaga is a good place for repairs, as well as being a relatively inexpensive place; nevertheless, he estimates that they will be in port for a month (BW2:319)
- [USS *Chesapeake*]() has a sprung bowsprit, and thus is stranded in Malta (BW2:326, 28 November 1802)

### To persons
- A strange little episode: 2 midshipmen from the [USS *Essex*]() went on shore, where it seems that they dueled with each other, and Mr. Higginbotham killed Mr. Swartwout. Uncertain whether this occurred in Gibraltar or Algeciras. Higginbotham was arrested, and permission to bury Swartwout in Gibraltar was denied. (BW2:96, 27 March 1802) Swartwout was ultimately buried in Algeciras, Fort St. Iago, 28 March 1802 (BW2:97). (See also [Death by violence]().)
- BW2:203: [USS *Essex*](), 14 July 1802, records a storm that carried away “Main top mast, main & fore top gallt yards & split Main top gallt mast. Jno Bradley & Jno Weyant seamen went overboard with the rigging & were lost.” (See also [Weather](), [Accidental deaths]().)
- BW2:300: A barge from the [USS *Enterprise*]() overturned with 8 men in it; 4 men were rescued, but 4 drowned, 16 October 1802 (see also [Accidental deaths]())
- BW2:342: [Alexander Murray]() writes to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that he "had the misfortune of getting my left Thumb & Finger almost torn off to the hand in directing the veering out of a Cable in a heavy Gale we have had here, the ring ropes having been badly put on, I fear I shall loose them" (29 December 1802)
