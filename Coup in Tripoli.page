- [Hamet Karamanli]() reinitiates contact with the Americans; Eaton responds, "On the morning of the 3d Nov. I red a message from Sidi Mahomet Bashaw, the exile from Tripoli, informing me that his brother, the usurper, had addressed the Dey of Algiers and begged his mediation to bring about a reconciliation with the American government; and expressed great solicitude to know whether, in my opinion, the Americans would admit such an intervention? I did not hessitate to give it as my opinion that my Government, haring once been deceived by that Dey, would now seek to establish their peace on a surer base. He then desired to be advised whethcr he might place my reliance on the operations of the Americans in his behalf - I recommended to him patience and silence; at the same time gave him leave to entertain the hope (may it not be illusive) that the next summers Operations would favor his views" (13 December 1801; BW1:637) 
- [Hamet Karamanli]() seems to want to back out of the plan [William Eaton]() had devised; Eaton tells him he cannot go elsewhere or Eaton will turn him over to the United States government as a prisoner of war (18 March 1802, BW2:90-91)
- In the circumstance that Karamanli boarded a ship to Derna, William Eaton instructed the captain of the *Gloria,* [Joseph Bounds]() (not a naval ship) to stop that ship, take Hamet and his entourage off the ship, and deliver them to the first ship of war they saw, or else take them to Leghorn to [James Leander Cathcart]() (BW2:95, 24 March 1802)
- Eaton apparently promised Hamet $10,000, which he saw as a bargain compared to the $1,000,000 they would pay Yusuf in tribute (BW2:97, 28 March 1802)
- Eaton writes a letter to any American commander who might intercept Hamet, asking that they give Hamet any assistance to get to Malta, where Hamet is supposed to wait for him (BW2:97, 29 March 1802)
- [Andrew Sterett]() reports that Hamet made it to Malta; Eaton is pleased with how things are going: " things seem to be in a good train notwithstanding former reports." (BW2:158, 21 May 1802)
- BW2:224: [William Eaton]() writes to SecState that he had heard that Yusuf Karamanli was upset when he heard that Hamet was in Malta, and he arrested several leaders of villages; "a spirit of Universal discontentment and revolt pervade all clases of the subjects except a few personally attached to the reigning Bashaw"
    - [Yusuf Karamanli]() has furthermore decreed that he will burn all American and Swedish prisoners if a shot is fired at Tripoli town: Eaton declares "Shall such a monster live, and dictate laws to nations who could crush him!" (5 August 1802)
- BW2:227: [William Eaton]() writes to [Hamet Karamanli]() to entreat him to stay in Malta and not return to Derna, where he believes [Yusuf Karamanli]() would try to kill him, but instead to stay in communication with his supporters in Tripoli and to promise them redress of grievances, 6 August 1802
    - BW2:240: [William Eaton]() writes that Hamet's desire to return from Tunis to Derna was due to [Yusuf Karamanli]()'s promising Hamet the rule of Derna in exchange for not going through with the coup
    - Eaton apparently convinced Hamet of Yusuf's nefarious intentions, but Hamet had to leave Tunis because the bey refused him further help
    - Eaton used the [*Gloria*]() as his personal conveyance to make sure that Hamet made it to Malta successfully (which [Alexander Murray]() later took issue with
- BW2:239: [Alexander Murray]() records a conversation with [Hamet Karamanli](): "I have this day had a communication with the Ligal Bashaw of Tripoli, & offered to take him to Derne & to aid him in any measures he chose to pursue, but he thinks it will be more to our advantage as well as his, to go there in an English Brig that he hath Chartered, and to try what force he can raise there, in as private a manner as possible, after which, in conjunction with the Swedish Force we can further cooperate with him by private Signals agreed upon - I am pleased with his Candor, & am purswaided if he get reinstated in his Dominions he will be Friendly to us" (18 August 1802)
- BW2:244: SecState notes that this strategy is highly irregular but concedes that it might be beneficial nonetheless (22 August 1802)
- BW2:250-51: [James Leander Cathcart]() writes that [Yusuf Karamanli]()'s hold on Tripoli is tenuous and that all his subjects hate him and he is constantly fearful of uprisings (25 August 1802)
    - Cathcart also seems to be claiming that using Hamet to stage a coup was his idea to begin with
    - Cathcart applauds Eaton's work to make the coup happen: "I must do Mt Eaton the justice to say that they [Eaton's actions] seem to have been judicious dictated by imperious necessity & an honest zeal for the success of an enterprize which promised such vast advantages to our Country"
- BW2:317: [Richard Valentine Morris]() writes to [Hamet Karamanli]()'s agent in response to a request made by Hamet, apparently for money, that he doesn't have authority to give money but that Hamet should write to the US government and will likely get his request (20 November 1802)
- BW2:347: [Hamet Karamanli]() listens to Morris, and writes directly to [Thomas Jefferson]() asking for $40,000 and some guns and stores, "which I promise to re ay them whenever we take Tripoli and shall always remain the faithful friend of the United States of America" (20 January 1803)
    - Hamet thinks he can raise 100,000 men to take back Tripoli and get his wife and kids back
- BW2:352: [Richard Valentine Morris]() meets with an agent of Hamet's in Tunis, who conveys this information and requests: "[Hamet Guirgies](), Agent of Hamet bashaw the dethroned sovereign of Tripoli, and now Bey of Derna, waited at the Consular house this Evening, and reported that his Master only waited for the Co-operation of our Squadron to proceed against Tripoli; that he could bring to the assault 30,000 men, who are determined to conquer the usurper or die in the attempt. That should the event be propitious, which they had no reason to doubt. That Hamet Bashaw promised in behalf of himself and successors, a perpetual peace and friendship with the United States, and will not hesitate to sign the contract in anticipation, but at the same time observed that his Master requested a supply of 20 Quintals of powder, and 16,000 dollars in cash to aasist his Operations. The Commodore said he would consider how far, he would meet their proposals" (recorded by [James Leander Cathcart](), 27 February 1803, BW2:352) 
- BW2:352: [Hamet Guirgies]() returned the next day, where [Richard Valentine Morris]() refused him any money, but promised 20 barrels of powder and cooperation with Hamet off Tripoli. He also refused to take Guirgies back to Derna. "the Agent observed that Hamet Bashaw wes in Arms and if he succeeded without our assistance that we could not in justice expect a peace upon the same terms, that we would Obtain it if we Cooperated with him. We answered that whoever Governed Tripoli must expect to be forced to an honorable peace, though our wishes were to conclude one on terms of mutual convenience without having recourse to arms"
- BW2:486: [Nicholas Nissen]() reports: "The Bashaw's brother Sidi Hamed who accepted the Beylie of Derna has abondon'd his Government and has put himself under the protection of the Arabs of the Shiek el Nassyr the most powerful tribe in this part of Africa" (15 July 1803)
- BW3:61: [Nicholas Nissen]() reports that [Hamet Karamanli]() is occupying half of Derna, but [Yusuf Karamanli]() is in control of the other half, plus two cruisers off Derna to prevent Hamet from communicating with Malta (19 September 1803)

## Outcomes
- BW2:244: SecState already begins preparation for letting Hamet down after the United States has used him: "As far therefore as the views of the Brother may contribute to our success, the aid of them may be used for the purpose. Should this aid be found inapplicable or his own personal object unattainable, It wifl be due to the honor of the United States, and to the expectations he will have naturally formed, to treat his disappointment with much tenderness, and to restore him as nearly as may be, to the situation from which he was drawn; or to make some other convenient arrangement that may be more eligible to him. In case of a treaty of peace with the ruling Bashaw of Tripoli, perhaps it may be possible to make some stipulation, formal or informal, in favor of the Brother, which may be a desirable alleviation of his misfortune" (22 August 1802)
