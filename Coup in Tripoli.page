- [Hamet Karamanli]() reinitiates contact with the Americans; Eaton responds, "On the morning of the 3d Nov. I red a message from Sidi Mahomet Bashaw, the exile from Tripoli, informing me that his brother, the usurper, had addressed the Dey of Algiers and begged his mediation to bring about a reconciliation with the American government; and expressed great solicitude to know whether, in my opinion, the Americans would admit such an intervention? I did not hessitate to give it as my opinion that my Government, haring once been deceived by that Dey, would now seek to establish their peace on a surer base. He then desired to be advised whethcr he might place my reliance on the operations of the Americans in his behalf - I recommended to him patience and silence; at the same time gave him leave to entertain the hope (may it not be illusive) that the next summers Operations would favor his views" (13 December 1801; BW1:637)
