- [Hamet Karamanli]() reinitiates contact with the Americans; Eaton responds, "On the morning of the 3d Nov. I red a message from Sidi Mahomet Bashaw, the exile from Tripoli, informing me that his brother, the usurper, had addressed the Dey of Algiers and begged his mediation to bring about a reconciliation with the American government; and expressed great solicitude to know whether, in my opinion, the Americans would admit such an intervention? I did not hessitate to give it as my opinion that my Government, haring once been deceived by that Dey, would now seek to establish their peace on a surer base. He then desired to be advised whethcr he might place my reliance on the operations of the Americans in his behalf - I recommended to him patience and silence; at the same time gave him leave to entertain the hope (may it not be illusive) that the next summers Operations would favor his views" (13 December 1801; BW1:637) 
- [Hamet Karamanli]() seems to want to back out of the plan [William Eaton]() had devised; Eaton tells him he cannot go elsewhere or Eaton will turn him over to the United States government as a prisoner of war (18 March 1802, BW2:90-91)
- In the circumstance that Karamanli boarded a ship to Derna, William Eaton instructed the captain of the *Gloria,* [Joseph Bounds]() (not a naval ship) to stop that ship, take Hamet and his entourage off the ship, and deliver them to the first ship of war they saw, or else take them to Leghorn to [James Leander Cathcart]() (BW2:95, 24 March 1802)
- Eaton apparently promised Hamet $10,000, which he saw as a bargain compared to the $1,000,000 they would pay Yusuf in tribute (BW2:97, 28 March 1802)
