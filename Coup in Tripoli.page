- [Hamet Karamanli]() reinitiates contact with the Americans; Eaton responds, "On the morning of the 3d Nov. I red a message from Sidi Mahomet Bashaw, the exile from Tripoli, informing me that his brother, the usurper, had addressed the Dey of Algiers and begged his mediation to bring about a reconciliation with the American government; and expressed great solicitude to know whether, in my opinion, the Americans would admit such an intervention? I did not hessitate to give it as my opinion that my Government, haring once been deceived by that Dey, would now seek to establish their peace on a surer base. He then desired to be advised whethcr he might place my reliance on the operations of the Americans in his behalf - I recommended to him patience and silence; at the same time gave him leave to entertain the hope (may it not be illusive) that the next summers Operations would favor his views" (13 December 1801; BW1:637) 
- [Hamet Karamanli]() seems to want to back out of the plan [William Eaton]() had devised; Eaton tells him he cannot go elsewhere or Eaton will turn him over to the United States government as a prisoner of war (18 March 1802, BW2:90-91)
- In the circumstance that Karamanli boarded a ship to Derna, William Eaton instructed the captain of the *Gloria,* [Joseph Bounds]() (not a naval ship) to stop that ship, take Hamet and his entourage off the ship, and deliver them to the first ship of war they saw, or else take them to Leghorn to [James Leander Cathcart]() (BW2:95, 24 March 1802)
- Eaton apparently promised Hamet $10,000, which he saw as a bargain compared to the $1,000,000 they would pay Yusuf in tribute (BW2:97, 28 March 1802)
- Eaton writes a letter to any American commander who might intercept Hamet, asking that they give Hamet any assistance to get to Malta, where Hamet is supposed to wait for him (BW2:97, 29 March 1802)
- [Andrew Sterett]() reports that Hamet made it to Malta; Eaton is pleased with how things are going: " things seem to be in a good train notwithstanding former reports." (BW2:158, 21 May 1802)
- BW2:224: [William Eaton]() writes to SecState that he had heard that Yusuf Karamanli was upset when he heard that Hamet was in Malta, and he arrested several leaders of villages; "a spirit of Universal discontentment and revolt pervade all clases of the subjects except a few personally attached to the reigning Bashaw"
    - [Yusuf Karamanli]() has furthermore decreed that he will burn all American and Swedish prisoners if a shot is fired at Tripoli town: Eaton declares "Shall such a monster live, and dictate laws to nations who could crush him!" (5 August 1802)
- BW2:227: [William Eaton]() writes to [Hamet Karamanli]() to entreat him to stay in Malta and not return to Derna, where he believes [Yusuf Karamanli]() would try to kill him, but instead to stay in communication with his supporters in Tripoli and to promise them redress of grievances, 6 August 1802
    - BW2:240: [William Eaton]() writes that Hamet's desire to return from Tunis to Derna was due to [Yusuf Karamanli]()'s promising Hamet the rule of Derna in exchange for not going through with the coup
    - Eaton apparently convinced Hamet of Yusuf's nefarious intentions, but Hamet had to leave Tunis because the bey refused him further help
    - Eaton used the [*Gloria*]() as his personal conveyance to make sure that Hamet made it to Malta successfully (which [Alexander Murray]() later took issue with
- BW2:239: [Alexander Murray]() records a conversation with [Hamet Karamanli](): "I have this day had a communication with the Ligal Bashaw of Tripoli, & offered to take him to Derne & to aid him in any measures he chose to pursue, but he thinks it will be more to our advantage as well as his, to go there in an English Brig that he hath Chartered, and to try what force he can raise there, in as private a manner as possible, after which, in conjunction with the Swedish Force we can further cooperate with him by private Signals agreed upon - I am pleased with his Candor, & am purswaided if he get reinstated in his Dominions he will be Friendly to us" (18 August 1802)
- BW2:244: SecState notes that this strategy is highly irregular but concedes that it might be beneficial nonetheless (22 August 1802)


## Outcomes
- BW2:244: SecState already begins preparation for letting Hamet down after the United States has used him: "As far therefore as the views of the Brother may contribute to our success, the aid of them may be used for the purpose. Should this aid be found inapplicable or his own personal object unattainable, It wifl be due to the honor of the United States, and to the expectations he will have naturally formed, to treat his disappointment with much tenderness, and to restore him as nearly as may be, to the situation from which he was drawn; or to make some other convenient arrangement that may be more eligible to him. In case of a treaty of peace with the ruling Bashaw of Tripoli, perhaps it may be possible to make some stipulation, formal or informal, in favor of the Brother, which may be a desirable alleviation of his misfortune" (22 August 1802)
