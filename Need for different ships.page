- BW2:193: [Alexander Murray]() believes that they need smaller ships on par with the Tripolitan vessels, and thus recommends actually reducing the number of frigates in the squadron in favor of smaller schooners like the [USS *Enterprise*]() (5 July 1802)
- BW2:196: [James Leander Cathcart]() writes: " It is impossible to block Tripoli with large ships so as to prevent these row-boats from stealing out; it is equa B ly impossible for the ships to catch them when out: they may have a rendezvous in every port on the Barbary coast, where they may sell their prizes and take in provisions - I have never ceased to suggest these dangers to the proper department - and an opinion that we have no remedy against the evils resulting from them but by taking a decided position against Tripoli; or by covering their coast with small vessels of war. That regency has not, at this moment, a single vessel able to fight the Schooner Enterprize - If then it is intended to carry on a naval war, until the resourses of Tripoli shall be exhausted, it is best to employ in the service man such vessels: experience has proved to U S. that they are more useful than frigates in this kind of warfare - And it seems that it is from experience alone that men and nations will be convinced of their danger, or of proper measures of defence" (9 July 1802) 
- BW2:208: [Anthony Terry](), vice consul at Cadiz, also suggests a shallower draft fleet would be more efficacious, "according to the prevailing Opinion amongst the well informed here" (22 July 1802)
- BW2:214: [Andrew Morris]() recommends one frigate and two small vessels to cruise off Cape Bon (28 July 1802)
- BW2:218: [Alexander Murray]() reiterates his suggestion for smaller vessels: "if we are still to carry on this kind of Warfare, be assured Sir, that it will be necessary to encrease our force, with Brigs or Schooners which will be fully adequate to any force they can have to encounter with belonging to Tripoli & they can pursue their small craft in any direction where Frigates cannot venture provided they have sweeps, to row after them for few of their Galleys carry more than 8 Guns & forty men" (30 July 1802)
- BW2:261: SecNav authorizes the purchase of gunboats---but not for off Tripoli. Rather, they are for protecting American merchants in the calms off Gibraltar (31 August 1802)
    - BW2:347: SecNav requests a 4-foot-long model of the gunboat used at Algeciras (24 January 1803)
- BW2:291: [James Leander Cathcart]() wants smaller vessels as well, but for a different reason: "I certainly should prefer purchasing three or four small vessels to serve as bombketches and gunboats occasionally, for should one of our Frigates be dismasted it would cost more to refit her than the loss on the purchase of those vessels besides keeping so large a number of men inactive for two months at least" (12 October 1802) 
- BW2:297: [Richard Valentine Morris]() wants smaller vessels as well, particularly vessels with sweeps; he expresses doubt that they are available in the Mediterranean, however, as he believes that the other Barbary states would not be willing to provide instruments of war against their fellow regencies (15 October 1802)
- BW2:337: SecNav writes to [William Bainbridge]() to ask his opinion about smaller vessels: "As it is probable that I may be called on for information on this subject, I wish previously to avail myself of the opinion of Gentlemen who have had experience of the Mediterranean Seas, and of the mode of warfare pursued by the Tripolines. I shall, therefore, be obliged to you for your opimon as well with respect to the size as the fashion of rigging & arming vessels for this service" (23 December 1802)
