- BW2:193: [Alexander Murray]() believes that they need smaller ships on par with the Tripolitan vessels, and thus recommends actually reducing the number of frigates in the squadron in favor of smaller schooners like the [USS *Enterprise*]() (5 July 1802)
- BW2:196: [James Leander Cathcart]() writes: " It is impossible to block Tripoli with large ships so as to prevent these row-boats from stealing out; it is equa B ly impossible for the ships to catch them when out: they may have a rendezvous in every port on the Barbary coast, where they may sell their prizes and take in provisions - I have never ceased to suggest these dangers to the proper department - and an opinion that we have no remedy against the evils resulting from them but by taking a decided position against Tripoli; or by covering their coast with small vessels of war. That regency has not, at this moment, a single vessel able to fight the Schooner Enterprize - If then it is intended to carry on a naval war, until the resourses of Tripoli shall be exhausted, it is best to employ in the service man such vessels: experience has proved to U S. that they are more useful than frigates in this kind of warfare - And it seems that it is from experience alone that men and nations will be convinced of their danger, or of proper measures of defence" (9 July 1802) 
- BW2:208: [Anthony Terry](), vice consul at Cadiz, also suggests a shallower draft fleet would be more efficacious, "according to the prevailing Opinion amongst the well informed here" (22 July 1802)
