The blockade was mostly a passive strategy; [Richard Dale]() and [Richard Valentine Morris]() seemed to be mostly ok with that idea. But [Edward Preble]() prefers to take a more active approach to the Tripolitan problem.

- BW2:488: "I have been informed that the Tripolines have a very considerable coasting trade in which they employ a number of vessels from 30 to 150 tons constructed and rigged in a manner peculiar to the Mediterranean.
If Colo Lear should not be successfull in his mission can I be authorized to hire or purchase three or four vessels of about 40 or 50 tons of the above description-either at Malta or elsewhere: for the purpose of capturing or destroying the Tripoline Merchant Vessels, and distressing their coast? Those Vessels should arm as they do their coasters say with two or four Guns on deck and should man them with an enterprizing Lieutenant, three or four Midshipmen a Surgeons Mate, and about 50 or 60 petty Officers Seamen and Marines from the Squadron, Only a certain number to appear on deck at a time when near the coast, or in sight of any vessel, and those to be in the Tripoline Garb with the turban - This method would enable them to approach the Coast without suspicion for the purpose of reconnoitering and probably be the means of capturing some valuable prizes" (16 July 1803--before [Edward Preble]() had even left the USA)
