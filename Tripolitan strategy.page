# Blockade running



# Alternate vessels
- BW1:613: Purchase of a polacre in Leghorn (1 Nov 1801)
- BW1:633: Possible purchase of a 22-gun vessel in Smyrna, manned by Europeans (10 December 1801)

# Alternate crews
- BW1:615: Renegados from all nations join the crews of Tripolitan cruisers, and therefore they might be able to stay out in the winter time (a possibility [Richard Dale]() had previously thought unlikely), making [Convoy]() duty a difficulty

# Joining forces with other Barbary States
- BW1:615: [Richard Dale]() is concerned that Tripoli is trying to get the other Barbary States to join forces against the USA, and that he has already succeeded in convincing Tunis to join (6 Nov 1801)
