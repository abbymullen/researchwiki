# Blockade running
- BW1:645: [Nicholas Nissen]() reports that there were 5 vessels out in the sea to capture Americans, though one was lost with all hands (20 December 1801)
- BW2:228: [William Eaton]() records that the bey of Tunis acknowledged that the Tunisians could not fight the Americans head-to-head, but "You cannot do us any hurt. We will lay up our large ships and send out our small cruisers to distress your commerce - A fly in a man's throat, said he, though it will not kill him, will make him vomit." (7 August 1802)
- BW2:278: [Alexander Murray]() records this strategy: "off Cape Bon the only place we can have a chance of meeting with them, for such is the nature of the Coast of Barbary that they have Ports, & protection every thirty or forty Miles in the whole extent, & they never get from under cover of the Land till they run over to the European Coast for a dash, to the place they mean to try their fortune, & so well are they disguised that 'twill be hard to discriminate between them, & the Cruizers of Algiers, & Tunis, they all wear Red Colours, & can buy, or enter into collusions with the Galleys of those Regencies to procure the Pasports of our Consuls with facility, the Vessels are of the same discription, $ nothing can discover them but an act of Captureing our Vessels, or Prisoners on
board" (18 September 1802)


# Alternate vessels
- BW1:613: Purchase of a polacre in Leghorn (1 Nov 1801)
- BW1:633: Possible purchase of a 22-gun vessel in Smyrna, manned by Europeans (10 December 1801)

# Alternate crews
- BW1:615: Renegados from all nations join the crews of Tripolitan cruisers, and therefore they might be able to stay out in the winter time (a possibility [Richard Dale]() had previously thought unlikely), making [Convoy]() duty a difficulty
- "I Suspect many Vagabonds will enter that Service for want of employment in the Privateering line, this only will enable them to put many Cruizers to Sea, being themselves destitute of good Sailors" (10 December 1801, BW1:633)

# Joining forces with other Barbary States
- BW1:615: [Richard Dale]() is concerned that Tripoli is trying to get the other Barbary States to join forces against the USA, and that he has already succeeded in convincing Tunis to join (6 Nov 1801)

# Deception
- BW2:312: [William Eaton]() advises [Richard Valentine Morris]() that the Tripolitan cruiser is going to use disguise to fool the Americans: "He has dressed his people in short blue jackets, overalls, and hats, for a decoy" (9 November 1802)
