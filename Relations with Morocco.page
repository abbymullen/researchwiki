- Morocco also wants to do something about the ships blockaded at Gibraltar. The Emperor of Morocco requested that the ships be given a passport to go home. [Richard Dale]() writes to [James Simpson]() in response: "You will please to Inform the Governor of Tangier, that the U.S. did not make war against the Bey of Tripoli; the Bey of Tripoli made war against the U.S. without any caus what ever on the part of the United States it is the wish of the President, to be at peace, and in friendship, with all nations, But as the Bey of Tripoli has made war without any cause, it is my duty, to take and detain his corsairs where ever I find them, nor do I think the good Since of His Highness the Emperor of Morocco, will permitt him to think that I have done wrong in so doing" (BW2:78, 4 March 1802)
    - [Alexander Murray]() notes later that they should have just let the Tripolitan ship go a long time ago, and then capture it, rather than tie up an American vessel for months watching it in Gibraltar harbor (BW2:328, 30 November 1802)
- [Richard Dale]() is still concerned about Morocco, though: he writes to [James Simpson]() that he should see the emperor of Morocco personally in order to "do away if possible those unjust Ideas that the Tripoline Ambassador has empressed on his mind, in favour of his Master, to the prejudice of the United States, ... it appears to me that the Emperor is desided in taking part with the Bey of Tripoli, how far he intends to go I cannot tell, it is very much, to be dreaded, his going to war with the United States, he can do us more Injury than all the other powers put together, therefore we must do every thing we can to keep peace with him" (BW2:81)
- [James Simpson]() writes to Sec of State that he has not taken the hard line Dale recommended with the emperor of Morocco, regarding the passports for the Tripolitan ship; instead, he has demurred by saying Dale did not have time to discuss it with the Swedish admiral before he was forced to return home, so the emperor would have to wait for a decision until Dale's successor arrived and could speak to [Soderstrom](). " At all events it certainly is Best, should the request be ultimately found such as cannot be granted? that Sweden join in the refusal, as it can do no good that the United States come forward alone with such, before Admiral Cederstroms sentiments be known." (BW2:92, 19 March 1802)
- BW2:114: SecNav informs [Richard Valentine Morris]() of the state of affairs with Morocco and requests, "We should be very much wanting in our duty, if these circumstances did not excite a precautionary vigilance with respect to the Emperor's movements. They may eventuate in an open declaration of hostilities which we ought to be seasonably prepared to meet. I request you therefore by all proper means, to inform yourself of all the Emperor's movements & do not fail to give me full and frequent information on the subject" (13 April 1802)

### War declaration

- BW2:186: Morocco declared war on USA on 19 April 1802: " When we consider how very trivial the object of sending some Cargoes of Wheat, to be distributed in Charity to the poor at Tripoly is, put in comparison with going to War with a Nation, it is scarce to be believed that the Emperour of Morocco would have adopted so serrious a measure for that only object"--hard to tell whether [James Simpson]() believes his own country at fault here or Morocco
    - Simpson decides to remain at Gibraltar to keep an eye on Morocco's ships
- BW2:190: [James Simpson]() receives a letter from the governor of Tangier inviting him to return to Tangier for 6 months; Simpson is not impressed by this offer: " Had this order arrived in time to prevent my expulsion, all would have been well; as in the time mentioned a negotiation might have been carried on, and any differences accommodated; but it appears to me since His Majesty saw fit to declare he was at War with the United States, and in consequence thereof to direct, that their Consul should be driven from his dominions, something beyond this Letter from a Governour will be highly necessary" (3 July 1802) 
    - Simpson decides he needs to consult with [Richard Valentine Morris]() before deciding whether to return to Tangier or not, though of course the [USS *Chesapeake*]() had just left on a cruise before Tripoli, so Simpson sends a letter with the [USS *Enterprise*]() asking to rendezvous with Morris as soon as possible (BW2:190, 3 July 1802)
- BW2:206: SecNav orders 100 gun carriages as present for the emperor of Morocco (20 July 1802)
    - BW2:239: Order is apparently countermanded, reports SecNav to [James Barron](), 19 August 1802
    - BW2:303: Order for gunn carriages reinstated, around 21 October 1802
- BW2:207: SecState reports that the emperor of Morocco has removed his request for passports to Tripoli, but that the president of the US has also granted passports for Moroccan vessels to travel to Tunis, 22 July 1802
    - Cultivating peace with Morocco seen as an incentive for Tripoli to make peace
- BW2:210: [James Simpson]() goes to Tangier to negotiate peace with Morocco; he also notes that the Moroccan frigate that has been being built is ready for launch and has been authorized to attack Americans (27 July 1802)
- BW2:220: [James Simpson]() writes to the emperor of Morocco pleading patience, as the channels of communication between the United States and the Mediterranean are terribly slow (31 July 1802)
- BW2:221: [James Simpson]() writes that the ship built to detain Americans is staying in port due to the presence of the [USS *Adams*]() and the [USS *Enterprise*](), and that Hajj Abdashaman Hashash (a Moroccan minister?) has promised to recommend discontinuation of hostilities toward America; Simpson did agree to let a Moroccan ship go to Tunis with wheat (3 August 1802)

### Reestablishment of peace
- BW2:226: [James Simpson]() receives a letter from Sidi Mahomet Ben Absalem Salawy, secretary of state of Morocco, 6 August 1802, reinstating the terms of their previous agreement--presents once a year, or if it is difficult to get to Morocco because of distance, every two years
    - Simpson is ordered to return to his house
    - Salawy maintains that the current unrest is entirely due to negligence by the Americans, but the emperor "now forgives all that"
- BW2:231: Simpson writes to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that as he has returned to his house and duties, Morris should "consider Peace restored," though there are a few details of the treaty left to be negotiated (12 August 1802)
- BW2:235-36: The path to peace is a bit rockier than Simpson expected: while negotiations are ongoing, Simpson suggests to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that he should leave the [USS *Adams*]() off Gibraltar, where it is available as a show of force and to salute with 13 guns when peace is officially re-established (16 August 1802)
- BW2:246: [Daniel Brent]() reports that the SecState's intention to send the gun carriages and a friendly letter to the emperor was countermanded by the heads of department (not quite sure whom this refers to), 31 August 1802
    - BW2:258: SecNav clarifies that these gun carriages were meant as a peace present to Morocco, and the declaration of war is what provoked the State Department to not send them (27 August 1802)
- BW2:263: Simpson writes to Salawy in response to an apparent request for another embassy (presents), stating that he is not aware of any stipulation in their treaty that would require such an embassy (1 September 1802)
- BW2:265: Morocco still wants a passport for the Tripolitan frigate at anchor in Gibraltar; Simpson writes that if the emperor decides to call the frigate Moroccan and request a passport, there's not a lot he can really do to resist that request and keep the peace (3 September 1802)
    - BW2:268: [Hugh G. Campbell]() ([USS *Adams*]()) reports that the emperor has indeed claimed the Tripolitan frigate and preparations are underway to send her to sea, as of August 27 (7 September 1802)
    - Campbell refused to grant a passport unless the emperor could produce vouchers that demonstrated that the frigate really belonged to Morocco
    - Campbell entreated Simpson to figure out what to do, as without a passport, which Campbell would not grant, he would be required to seize the frigate, which would undoubtedly lead to war with Morocco
- BW2:280-81: Selawy chides Simpson for not coming to transact his business in person, telling him he's lucky that Simpson's letter passed through Selawy's hands so that Selawy could adequately represent it to the emperor (20 September 1802)
- BW2:284: Simpson writes to Selawy that he is "a perfect stranger" to the idea that the treaty between the USA and Morocco dictates yearly gifts, citing the treaty of 1795 (27 September 1802) 

## [Meshouda]()
- BW2:275: Simpson and Campbell asked for voucher from the emperor of Morocco that the Tripolitan ship was actually his, and he gave it to them: " she carrys Our Victorious Flag, and goes on the fulfillment of Our Orders and intentions. - Let no one oppose her or hinder her, neither do her any Injury; and we Order all the Consuls to despatch her, and deliver their Passports." 
- BW2:337-38: After a passport was granted to the Meshouda, apparently its captain felt that the [USS *Adams*]() ([Hugh G. Campbell]()) was just waiting outside Gibraltar to capture it if it left; therefore, Meshouda stayed in Gibraltar and its captain filed a complaint with the Moroccan government (24 December 1802)
- BW2:470-71: [James Simpson]() outlines the benefits/detriments of [Richard Valentine Morris]()'s plan to let the Meshouda be condemned by an international court: "I am well aware that the circumstances of the Meshouda case would justify Commodore Morris going to every rigour with her, were the Ship under the Flag of any Power by whom the Law of Nations is observed, but I conclude he made a distinction when in his Letter to me he says, "she shall not be Condemned if proved that this was not the "Order of the Emperour. It is however expected that the "Captain will be severely punished if it is an Act of his own." It was upon this principle and not from any sense of Justice on their side that I expressed my hopes to the Commodore the Ship would be liberated: --her Condemnation I am fully persuaded would give the highest disgust to the Emperour, on the contrary its my oppinion her release would afford me, after what has happened, a happy opportunity of makeing a strong impression on his Majestys mind of the Friendly intentions of the Government of the United States towards him" (9 July 1803)
- BW2:513: [James Leander Cathcart]() writes to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that he feels the taking of the *Meshouda* as prize has caused "a rputure with Morocco & caused a division of our force at the moment when it could have been render'd the most serviciable" (15 August 1803)

## Tenuous peace
- [James Simpson]() repeatedly entreats [Richard Valentine Morris]() to post a ship or two near Morocco, just in case the Moroccan emperor should get any ideas about declaring war again: "I will not pretend to say it is America they intend to break with, but this I am certain, if they do it might have been prevented by one or two Frigates being constantly kept on this Station, the propriety of which I have long ago seen & mentioned to Government" (26 July 1803, BW2:498)
- BW3:8: [James Simpson]() writes to the emperor of Morocco after the taking of the *Mirboka*: " I beg leave to answer Your Majesty that I am highly disposed to receive such propositions as Your Majesty may be leased to make tho' me for a re-establishment of Peace, which I will transmit to the Commanding Officer of our Squadron in these Seas who is daily expected at Gibraltar, or send them on to America as circumstances may appear to render most proper for furtherance of the Grand object in view."
    - He outlines several things Morocco needs to do in order to be friends again:
    - Withdraw permission for Moroccan cruisers to attack American ships
    - Release Simpson from house arrest
- BW3:10: [James Simpson]() suggests that the *Mirboka* was given permission to attack Americans not by the emperor himself, but by Alcayde Hashash, " in whom the Emperor has of late placed unbonded confidence, insomuch that we have seen acts of his of a most extraordinary nature sanctioned by his master" (3 September 1803) 
- BW3:19: SecNav orders [Thomas Tingey]() to prepare 100 gun carriages for the emperor of Morocco quickly: "the exertions must be made to accomplish the business soon all other engagements must yield to this" (5 September 1803)
- BW3:20-21: William Court & Co. writes to [John Gavino]() that an American sloop of war should be dispatched to patrol and prevent *American* ships from entering Mogadore while relations with Morocco are uncertain, as one American brig has already been detained while things are uncertain (5 September 1803)
- BW3:26: Emperor of Morocco writes to the American consuls in Morocco (which would be [James Simpson]()? Anyone else?) that no consul is under arrest or will be captured in the event of war, but that the whole situation with the *Meshouda* is a big misunderstanding, and the ship should be brought to Tangier to sort things out (11 September 1803)

## Further rumblings of war
- BW3:31: [Edward Preble]() takes a more aggressive approach when he arrives in the Mediterranean: "The Emperors late gross Violation of our treaty in issuing Orders to his Cruisers, to Capture American Vessels, and one of his ships the Mirboka, Captain Abrahim Lubarez actually having taken one, will justify my giving Orders to the Captains of the Squadron under my command, to capture and bring into Port all vessels belonging to the Emperor of Morocco, or armed vessels belonging to his subjects, as I must consider them as acting under the Authority of the Emperor in capturing our vessels, knowlng that they dare not act without such Authority, and if I can asscertain that the Maimona or an Moorish Cruiser has captured a single American vessel, & should meet with her; you may acquaint the Emperor from me, that it is my intention in future to sink every such vessel as a Pirate, as he denies having given Orders to justify their conduct" (13 September 1803)
- BW3:45: [James Simpson]() writes to [Edward Preble]() that he surmises Preble's perspective on the Moroccan vessels is correct; but he advises: " I am fully satisfied the Emperour will positively deny having authorised any such being given his Captains, - from the thorough knowledge I have of these people I perfectly believe that Muley Soliman did not know the particular Orders Hashash gave Lubarez, but that he confided in him & has been led into the situation he now is with the United Stabs unintentionaly. - This even admitted I will fully allow in no Justification of what has happened, but if you find that the Emperour should be inclined to an accommodation I submit to you whether it would not be very adviseable to close with him on such terms as you may consider honorable, rather than press a continuation of hostilities" (15 September 1803)
- BW3:46: [William Jarvis](), consul at Lisbon, writes a circular warning ships that there is a Moroccan cruiser at Lisbon for repairs, and her intentions are not certain; he describes the vessel and promises to write again when he knows her intentions (15 September 1803)
- BW3:48: [Edward Preble]() writes to [William Bainbridge]() that any Moroccan vessel he encounters is to be captured and sent to Gibraltar until the emperor countermands his order to attack American ships (16 September 1803)
- BW3:51-52: [Edward Preble]() writes to [James Simpson]() that he and [John Rodgers]() have come to Tangier in order to "[pursue] pacific measures" with Morocco, "provided it can be done with honor and propriety on the part of the United States"
    - They have brought with them the captains of the [*Meshouda*]() and *Mirboka*, as well as officers of the *Mirboka*, and they wish a representative of the Emperor to come and inspect the men and hear their story 
    - They also come with the order given to Rais Lubarez to capture American vessels, which they also invite a representative to come and inspect (17 September 1803)
- Privately, Preble has a much harsher perspective on the situation: "Went to Tanger to demand satisfaction for the insult offered our flag in the capture of the Celia" (BW3:53, 17 September 1803)

## Treachery
- BW3:56: [Edward Preble]() records how he boarded the [Maimona](), but had to release the ship when its passport from [James Simpson]() checked out under both Preble's scrutiny and the scrutiny of [Tobias Lear](), 18 September 1803
- BW3:57: [Edward Preble]() hears from [James Simpson]() that the governor of Tangier did not act on his own about the authorization to capture American ships; "Mr Simpson found an Opportunity to slip a letter into the packet, which confirms me in my first opinion that the Governor of Tangier has not acted without higher Authority, he states that he has a scene of the deepest treachery to unfold as soon as a personal interview can take place, and that the Emperor has been guilty of another act of hostility at Mogadore by seizing on the Brig Hannah of Salem Joseph W. Williams Master (who was there on a trading voyage) and making prisioners of the crew" (18 September 1803)
    - "I am fully aware, that it is for our interest to have peace with Morocco but it is not necessary, or proper that we should be so over anxious, as to induce them to believe we must have it, on any terms they choose to dictate"
- BW3:57: [James Simpson]() is not free to come off to meet [Edward Preble]() and [John Rodgers](), who had come in concert to negotiate; therefore, Rodgers left to cruise off Mogadore and Larach, and Preble returned to Gibraltar to get his new squadron together, until the emperor returned (18 September 1803)
    - Preble writes: " I shall weigh this evening and proceed to Tangier and endeavor by every honorable means to bring about an accommodation, but if that cannot be done, I shall make them feel that we are sensible of the injury & injustice they have done us, but shall take no hasty steps...you may rest assured that cringing to those Barbarians will not Answer I am fully aware, that it is for our interest to have peace with Morocco but it is not necessary, or proper that we should be so over anxious, as to induce them to believe we must have it, on any terms they choose to dictate"
- BW3:59: [Tobias Lear]() asks [Edward Preble]() to stay a little while in Gibraltar until things can be ironed out with Morocco, rather than risking commerce by taking a frigate away from Morocco to take Lear to Algiers (18 September 1803)
- BW3:60: [Alcayde Hashash]() writes to [James Simpson]() that the naval captains are welcome at Tangier or Tetuan, but that Simpson cannot be alone with them (18 September 1803)
- BW3:63: [Edward Preble]() reports that an American vessel [the *Hannah*] has been captured and brought to Mogadore; he tells [Richard Somers]() that he is authorized to bring in vessels belonging to the bashaw of Tripoli OR the emperor of Morocco (19 September 1803)
- BW3:64: [Edward Preble]() leaves orders for [Charles Stewart]() that he is specifically to target the *Maimona*, as well as to warn all merchant vessels that the USA is being targeted by Morocco (19 September 1803)
- BW3:68: [James Simpson]() writes to Alcayde Hashash that [Edward Preble]() had come to negotiate when he heard of the governor of Mogadore seizing an American vessel, and giving orders to continue to take American vessels, at which time he left Tangier to cruise; "I submit to Your Excy's consideration whether these be Acts of Peace or War." (21 September 1803)
    - Hashash writes that anything taken at Mogadore will be returned and he will be on the hook for any losses; and that Preble is welcome at Tangier or Tetuan anytime because the USA and Morocco are at peace (BW3:69, 22 September 1803)
- BW3:73: [Anthony Terry]() writes to [Thomas Appleton]() that he has heard a report that an English vessel saw a "Moorish Frigate" with 4 American prizes (21 September 1803)
    - BW3:96: Report turns out to be false
- BW3:74: Secretary of State of Morocco (Selawy) writes to [James Simpson]() that he should come to Tangier with the [*Mirboka*]() and possibly the [*Meshouda*](), when the emperor gets there, and listen only to the emperor and no one else; he warns, though, " beware of delays for this will be a great matter for you and for all those who support you and speak well of you here - dont be slack or deficient in this matter of consequence for yourself." (24 September 1803)--reiterates the warning to bring the ships in without tardiness, 25 September 1803 (BW3:77)
- BW3:76: [Edward Preble]() writes that he will gladly return the *Mirboka*, as long as the emperor did not order it to attack Americans and will punish whoever did; he will also withdraw orders he gave to the squadron to attack Moroccan vessels, returning to the treaty of 1786 (25 September 1803)
    - Preble had to want to get rid of the whole mess: he notes that the Moroccan officers are on board the *Constitution*, including the priest and the captain of the *Mirboka* who are living in Preble's cabin with him.
- BW3:85: [Tobias Lear]() records a conversation he and [Edward Preble]() had with Ibraham Raiz Lubarez, captain of the [*Mirboka*](): "We endeavoured to impress them with the injustice, as well as the impolicy of the Emperor's making war upon us, particularly in the insiduous manner in which it has now been done, where the passport of the Consul was obtained, which shd be held sacred, and never violated - That, altho' we wished for peace, yet, if forced into a war, we should be found formidable & terrible to the Moors, as they might well know, from what they have seen of our force - That the kind treatment which they had recd was not the effect of fear; but proceeded from principles of humanity and manliness which the Americans always exercised towards their enemies when they had them in their power - That the Emperor wd be much more benefitted by our Commerce, than he could by a war with us - That our Commerce extended to all nations, which would enable us to carry to the Moors every thing they could want; besides what was produced in our own Country; and that we should take from them such things as they had to dispose of, which wd be very profitable to the Merchants, as well as productive to the Revenue of the Emperor - That our Shipping was very numerous & powerful - That we wd strive all in our power to keep peace with them upon proper & honorable terms; but if we were obliged to go to war, we should not only destroy all their Vessels, which would not require much of our force to do; but we should send ships and batter down every Sea Port Town in the Empire" (19 September 1803)
    - Lubarez agreed with all this, saying the emperor was good but his advisers were bad
- BW3:96: Preble writes, "I have no doubt but this quarrel will eventually be for our advantage, as I do not believe his Imperial Majesty will be disposed to War with us again, & we shall get clear of having any thing to do with Ashash the former Governor of Tanger who has ever been opposed to our Interest." (1 October 1803)

## Peace again
- BW3:99: [Tobias Lear]() announces that [James Simpson]() has been freed from his captivity and all is well with Morocco (3 October 1803)
- BW3:107: [Edward Preble]() notes the presence of 7 foreign flags including the American one at Tangier (5 October 1803)
- BW3:111: The emperor sends the squadron a gift of 10 bullocks, 20 sheep, and 4 dozen fowls (7 October 1803)
- BW3:115: [James Simpson]() encourages [Edward Preble]() to offer the [*Mirboka*]() in exchange for the [*Hannah*]() and any other American prisoners, suggesting he'd get the better end of the deal because the *Mirboka* is a piece of junk (8 October 1803)
- BW3:118: Emperor of Morocco sets American ships and crews at liberty and declares peace to be restored, 8 October 1803
- BW3:119: [Edward Preble]() responds to Simpson's arguments by agreeing and releasing both the *Mirboka* and the *Meshouda* (8 OCtober 1803)
- BW3:123: [Edward Preble]() and [Tobias Lear]() go on shore to meet the emperor; the *Mirboka* arrives in Tangier (10 October 1803)
- BW3:142: Despite peace being restored, [Edward Preble]() leaves one ship off Gibraltar in order to remind the emperor of the force available to the USA if peace is again broken (16 October 1803)
- M148: 24 January 1804: [Isaac Hull]() records upon arrival in Tangier: I "am happy to inform you, that every thing remains peacable at that place, and that nothing has happened worth notice, since Commodore Preble left this station. The Emperors ships are all dismantled, and laid up at Sallee, and Larash, and no attempt has been made, to Equip any of them for sea, in the absence of the Squadron." ([Isaac Hull]() to SecNav Robert Smith)

# Other nations' relations with Morocco
- James Simpson reports on others' relations with Morocco:
    - Russia: no relationship with Morocco
    - Prussia: no official relationship; a captured Prussian ship was remediated through Spain
    - Sweden: sent presents of stores for 30 years without an official treaty; currently seem to be in treaty negotiations
    - Denmark: pays $25,000 annually in tribute, but has no commerce
    - Holland: has no ambassador, but has sent Admiral DeWinter possibly to start negotiations; Simpson notes that there aren't many Dutch ships in the Mediterranean
    - England: does not pay tribute or send presents; however, they're supposed to get unlimited provisions for their Mediterranean stations, and they haven't received them for several seasons
    - France: no consuls or embassies, no ratification of the treaty that had existed before; France does trade with Morocco but does not send presents or pay tribute
    - Portugal: Portugal and Morocco are in dispute with each other over some business transactions; Portugal does not pay tribute, but does give presents and allows Morocco's cruisers to refit at Lisbon
    - Spain: does not enforce the 1799 treaty with Morocco; Morocco actually owes Spanish agents $100,000; nevertheless, Spain still gives occasional presents
    - Germany: no official relationship, but Morocco allows German ships to trade unmolested, though they have requested an ambassador to make their peace official
    - Genoa: has not renewed its peace treaty with Morocco
    - Italy: no peace treaty
    - Ragusa: has no direct contact with Morocco, but does not fear capture because of annual service to the Ottoman Empire
    - Algiers: at peace; little contact by sea
    - Tunis: no contact by sea
    - Tripoli: no contact by sea; fairly decent trade over land; Morocco may favor Tripoli because of the rest area Tripoli provides for pilgrims from Morocco to Mecca
    - (All of these from BW2:340-41; 24 December 1802)
