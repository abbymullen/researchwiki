- Morocco also wants to do something about the ships blockaded at Gibraltar. The Emperor of Morocco requested that the ships be given a passport to go home. [Richard Dale]() writes to [James Simpson]() in response: "You will please to Inform the Governor of Tangier, that the U.S. did not make war against the Bey of Tripoli; the Bey of Tripoli made war against the U.S. without any caus what ever on the part of the United States it is the wish of the President, to be at peace, and in friendship, with all nations, But as the Bey of Tripoli has made war without any cause, it is my duty, to take and detain his corsairs where ever I find them, nor do I think the good Since of His Highness the Emperor of Morocco, will permitt him to think that I have done wrong in so doing" (BW2:78, 4 March 1802)
    - [Alexander Murray]() notes later that they should have just let the Tripolitan ship go a long time ago, and then capture it, rather than tie up an American vessel for months watching it in Gibraltar harbor (BW2:328, 30 November 1802)
- [Richard Dale]() is still concerned about Morocco, though: he writes to [James Simpson]() that he should see the emperor of Morocco personally in order to "do away if possible those unjust Ideas that the Tripoline Ambassador has empressed on his mind, in favour of his Master, to the prejudice of the United States, ... it appears to me that the Emperor is desided in taking part with the Bey of Tripoli, how far he intends to go I cannot tell, it is very much, to be dreaded, his going to war with the United States, he can do us more Injury than all the other powers put together, therefore we must do every thing we can to keep peace with him" (BW2:81)
- [James Simpson]() writes to Sec of State that he has not taken the hard line Dale recommended with the emperor of Morocco, regarding the passports for the Tripolitan ship; instead, he has demurred by saying Dale did not have time to discuss it with the Swedish admiral before he was forced to return home, so the emperor would have to wait for a decision until Dale's successor arrived and could speak to [Soderstrom](). " At all events it certainly is Best, should the request be ultimately found such as cannot be granted? that Sweden join in the refusal, as it can do no good that the United States come forward alone with such, before Admiral Cederstroms sentiments be known." (BW2:92, 19 March 1802)
- BW2:114: SecNav informs [Richard Valentine Morris]() of the state of affairs with Morocco and requests, "We should be very much wanting in our duty, if these circumstances did not excite a precautionary vigilance with respect to the Emperor's movements. They may eventuate in an open declaration of hostilities which we ought to be seasonably prepared to meet. I request you therefore by all proper means, to inform yourself of all the Emperor's movements & do not fail to give me full and frequent information on the subject" (13 April 1802)

### War declaration

- BW2:186: Morocco declared war on USA on 19 April 1802: " When we consider how very trivial the object of sending some Cargoes of Wheat, to be distributed in Charity to the poor at Tripoly is, put in comparison with going to War with a Nation, it is scarce to be believed that the Emperour of Morocco would have adopted so serrious a measure for that only object"--hard to tell whether [James Simpson]() believes his own country at fault here or Morocco
    - Simpson decides to remain at Gibraltar to keep an eye on Morocco's ships
- BW2:190: [James Simpson]() receives a letter from the governor of Tangier inviting him to return to Tangier for 6 months; Simpson is not impressed by this offer: " Had this order arrived in time to prevent my expulsion, all would have been well; as in the time mentioned a negotiation might have been carried on, and any differences accommodated; but it appears to me since His Majesty saw fit to declare he was at War with the United States, and in consequence thereof to direct, that their Consul should be driven from his dominions, something beyond this Letter from a Governour will be highly necessary" (3 July 1802) 
    - Simpson decides he needs to consult with [Richard Valentine Morris]() before deciding whether to return to Tangier or not, though of course the [USS *Chesapeake*]() had just left on a cruise before Tripoli, so Simpson sends a letter with the [USS *Enterprise*]() asking to rendezvous with Morris as soon as possible (BW2:190, 3 July 1802)
- BW2:206: SecNav orders 100 gun carriages as present for the emperor of Morocco (20 July 1802)
    - BW2:239: Order is apparently countermanded, reports SecNav to [James Barron](), 19 August 1802
    - BW2:303: Order for gunn carriages reinstated, around 21 October 1802
- BW2:207: SecState reports that the emperor of Morocco has removed his request for passports to Tripoli, but that the president of the US has also granted passports for Moroccan vessels to travel to Tunis, 22 July 1802
    - Cultivating peace with Morocco seen as an incentive for Tripoli to make peace
- BW2:210: [James Simpson]() goes to Tangier to negotiate peace with Morocco; he also notes that the Moroccan frigate that has been being built is ready for launch and has been authorized to attack Americans (27 July 1802)
- BW2:220: [James Simpson]() writes to the emperor of Morocco pleading patience, as the channels of communication between the United States and the Mediterranean are terribly slow (31 July 1802)
- BW2:221: [James Simpson]() writes that the ship built to detain Americans is staying in port due to the presence of the [USS *Adams*]() and the [USS *Enterprise*](), and that Hajj Abdashaman Hashash (a Moroccan minister?) has promised to recommend discontinuation of hostilities toward America; Simpson did agree to let a Moroccan ship go to Tunis with wheat (3 August 1802)

### Reestablishment of peace
- BW2:226: [James Simpson]() receives a letter from Sidi Mahomet Ben Absalem Salawy, secretary of state of Morocco, 6 August 1802, reinstating the terms of their previous agreement--presents once a year, or if it is difficult to get to Morocco because of distance, every two years
    - Simpson is ordered to return to his house
    - Salawy maintains that the current unrest is entirely due to negligence by the Americans, but the emperor "now forgives all that"
- BW2:231: Simpson writes to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that as he has returned to his house and duties, Morris should "consider Peace restored," though there are a few details of the treaty left to be negotiated (12 August 1802)
- BW2:235-36: The path to peace is a bit rockier than Simpson expected: while negotiations are ongoing, Simpson suggests to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that he should leave the [USS *Adams*]() off Gibraltar, where it is available as a show of force and to salute with 13 guns when peace is officially re-established (16 August 1802)
- BW2:246: [Daniel Brent]() reports that the SecState's intention to send the gun carriages and a friendly letter to the emperor was countermanded by the heads of department (not quite sure whom this refers to), 31 August 1802
    - BW2:258: SecNav clarifies that these gun carriages were meant as a peace present to Morocco, and the declaration of war is what provoked the State Department to not send them (27 August 1802)
- BW2:263: Simpson writes to Salawy in response to an apparent request for another embassy (presents), stating that he is not aware of any stipulation in their treaty that would require such an embassy (1 September 1802)
- BW2:265: Morocco still wants a passport for the Tripolitan frigate at anchor in Gibraltar; Simpson writes that if the emperor decides to call the frigate Moroccan and request a passport, there's not a lot he can really do to resist that request and keep the peace (3 September 1802)
    - BW2:268: [Hugh G. Campbell]() ([USS *Adams*]()) reports that the emperor has indeed claimed the Tripolitan frigate and preparations are underway to send her to sea, as of August 27 (7 September 1802)
    - Campbell refused to grant a passport unless the emperor could produce vouchers that demonstrated that the frigate really belonged to Morocco
    - Campbell entreated Simpson to figure out what to do, as without a passport, which Campbell would not grant, he would be required to seize the frigate, which would undoubtedly lead to war with Morocco
- BW2:280-81: Selawy chides Simpson for not coming to transact his business in person, telling him he's lucky that Simpson's letter passed through Selawy's hands so that Selawy could adequately represent it to the emperor (20 September 1802)
- BW2:284: Simpson writes to Selawy that he is "a perfect stranger" to the idea that the treaty between the USA and Morocco dictates yearly gifts, citing the treaty of 1795 (27 September 1802) 

## [Meshouda]()
- BW2:275: Simpson and Campbell asked for voucher from the emperor of Morocco that the Tripolitan ship was actually his, and he gave it to them: " she carrys Our Victorious Flag, and goes on the fulfillment of Our Orders and intentions. - Let no one oppose her or hinder her, neither do her any Injury; and we Order all the Consuls to despatch her, and deliver their Passports." 
- BW2:337-38: After a passport was granted to the Meshouda, apparently its captain felt that the [USS *Adams*]() ([Hugh G. Campbell]()) was just waiting outside Gibraltar to capture it if it left; therefore, Meshouda stayed in Gibraltar and its captain filed a complaint with the Moroccan government (24 December 1802)
- BW2:470-71: [James Simpson]() outlines the benefits/detriments of [Richard Valentine Morris]()'s plan to let the Meshouda be condemned by an international court: "I am well aware that the circumstances of the Meshouda case would justify Commodore Morris going to every rigour with her, were the Ship under the Flag of any Power by whom the Law of Nations is observed, but I conclude he made a distinction when in his Letter to me he says, "she shall not be Condemned if proved that this was not the "Order of the Emperour. It is however expected that the "Captain will be severely punished if it is an Act of his own." It was upon this principle and not from any sense of Justice on their side that I expressed my hopes to the Commodore the Ship would be liberated: --her Condemnation I am fully persuaded would give the highest disgust to the Emperour, on the contrary its my oppinion her release would afford me, after what has happened, a happy opportunity of makeing a strong impression on his Majestys mind of the Friendly intentions of the Government of the United States towards him" (9 July 1803)
- BW2:513: [James Leander Cathcart]() writes to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that he feels the taking of the *Meshouda* as prize has caused "a rputure with Morocco & caused a division of our force at the moment when it could have been render'd the most serviciable" (15 August 1803)

## Tenuous peace
- [James Simpson]() repeatedly entreats [Richard Valentine Morris]() to post a ship or two near Morocco, just in case the Moroccan emperor should get any ideas about declaring war again: "I will not pretend to say it is America they intend to break with, but this I am certain, if they do it might have been prevented by one or two Frigates being constantly kept on this Station, the propriety of which I have long ago seen & mentioned to Government" (26 July 1803, BW2:498)

# Other nations' relations with Morocco
- James Simpson reports on others' relations with Morocco:
    - Russia: no relationship with Morocco
    - Prussia: no official relationship; a captured Prussian ship was remediated through Spain
    - Sweden: sent presents of stores for 30 years without an official treaty; currently seem to be in treaty negotiations
    - Denmark: pays $25,000 annually in tribute, but has no commerce
    - Holland: has no ambassador, but has sent Admiral DeWinter possibly to start negotiations; Simpson notes that there aren't many Dutch ships in the Mediterranean
    - England: does not pay tribute or send presents; however, they're supposed to get unlimited provisions for their Mediterranean stations, and they haven't received them for several seasons
    - France: no consuls or embassies, no ratification of the treaty that had existed before; France does trade with Morocco but does not send presents or pay tribute
    - Portugal: Portugal and Morocco are in dispute with each other over some business transactions; Portugal does not pay tribute, but does give presents and allows Morocco's cruisers to refit at Lisbon
    - Spain: does not enforce the 1799 treaty with Morocco; Morocco actually owes Spanish agents $100,000; nevertheless, Spain still gives occasional presents
    - Germany: no official relationship, but Morocco allows German ships to trade unmolested, though they have requested an ambassador to make their peace official
    - Genoa: has not renewed its peace treaty with Morocco
    - Italy: no peace treaty
    - Ragusa: has no direct contact with Morocco, but does not fear capture because of annual service to the Ottoman Empire
    - Algiers: at peace; little contact by sea
    - Tunis: no contact by sea
    - Tripoli: no contact by sea; fairly decent trade over land; Morocco may favor Tripoli because of the rest area Tripoli provides for pilgrims from Morocco to Mecca
    - (All of these from BW2:340-41; 24 December 1802)
