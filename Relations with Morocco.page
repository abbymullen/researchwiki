- Morocco also wants to do something about the ships blockaded at Gibraltar. The Emperor of Morocco requested that the ships be given a passport to go home. [Richard Dale]() writes to [James Simpson]() in response: "You will please to Inform the Governor of Tangier, that the U.S. did not make war against the Bey of Tripoli; the Bey of Tripoli made war against the U.S. without any caus what ever on the part of the United States it is the wish of the President, to be at peace, and in friendship, with all nations, But as the Bey of Tripoli has made war without any cause, it is my duty, to take and detain his corsairs where ever I find them, nor do I think the good Since of His Highness the Emperor of Morocco, will permitt him to think that I have done wrong in so doing" (BW2:78, 4 March 1802)
- [Richard Dale]() is still concerned about Morocco, though: he writes to [James Simpson]() that he should see the emperor of Morocco personally in order to "do away if possible those unjust Ideas that the Tripoline Ambassador has empressed on his mind, in favour of his Master, to the prejudice of the United States, ... it appears to me that the Emperor is desided in taking part with the Bey of Tripoli, how far he intends to go I cannot tell, it is very much, to be dreaded, his going to war with the United States, he can do us more Injury than all the other powers put together, therefore we must do every thing we can to keep peace with him" (BW2:81)
- [James Simpson]() writes to Sec of State that he has not taken the hard line Dale recommended with the emperor of Morocco, regarding the passports for the Tripolitan ship; instead, he has demurred by saying Dale did not have time to discuss it with the Swedish admiral before he was forced to return home, so the emperor would have to wait for a decision until Dale's successor arrived and could speak to [Soderstrom](). " At all events it certainly is Best, should the request be ultimately found such as cannot be granted? that Sweden join in the refusal, as it can do no good that the United States come forward alone with such, before Admiral Cederstroms sentiments be known." (BW2:92, 19 March 1802)
- BW2:114: SecNav informs [Richard Valentine Morris]() of the state of affairs with Morocco and requests, "We should be very much wanting in our duty, if these circumstances did not excite a precautionary vigilance with respect to the Emperor's movements. They may eventuate in an open declaration of hostilities which we ought to be seasonably prepared to meet. I request you therefore by all proper means, to inform yourself of all the Emperor's movements & do not fail to give me full and frequent information on the subject" (13 April 1802)

### War declaration

- BW2:186: Morocco declared war on USA on 19 April 1802: " When we consider how very trivial the object of sending some Cargoes of Wheat, to be distributed in Charity to the poor at Tripoly is, put in comparison with going to War with a Nation, it is scarce to be believed that the Emperour of Morocco would have adopted so serrious a measure for that only object"--hard to tell whether [James Simpson]() believes his own country at fault here or Morocco
    - Simpson decides to remain at Gibraltar to keep an eye on Morocco's ships
- BW2:190: [James Simpson]() receives a letter from the governor of Tangier inviting him to return to Tangier for 6 months; Simpson is not impressed by this offer: " Had this order arrived in time to prevent my expulsion, all would have been well; as in the time mentioned a negotiation might have been carried on, and any differences accommodated; but it appears to me since His Majesty saw fit to declare he was at War with the United States, and in consequence thereof to direct, that their Consul should be driven from his dominions, something beyond this Letter from a Governour will be highly necessary" (3 July 1802) 
    - Simpson decides he needs to consult with [Richard Valentine Morris]() before deciding whether to return to Tangier or not, though of course the [USS *Chesapeake*]() had just left on a cruise before Tripoli, so Simpson sends a letter with the [USS *Enterprise*]() asking to rendezvous with Morris as soon as possible (BW2:190, 3 July 1802)
- BW2:206: SecNav orders 100 gun carriages as present for the emperor of Morocco (20 July 1802)
    - BW2:239: Order is apparently countermanded, reports SecNav to [James Barron](), 19 August 1802
- BW2:207: SecState reports that the emperor of Morocco has removed his request for passports to Tripoli, but that the president of the US has also granted passports for Moroccan vessels to travel to Tunis, 22 July 1802
    - Cultivating peace with Morocco seen as an incentive for Tripoli to make peace
- BW2:210: [James Simpson]() goes to Tangier to negotiate peace with Morocco; he also notes that the Moroccan frigate that has been being built is ready for launch and has been authorized to attack Americans (27 July 1802)
- BW2:220: [James Simpson]() writes to the emperor of Morocco pleading patience, as the channels of communication between the United States and the Mediterranean are terribly slow (31 July 1802)
- BW2:221: [James Simpson]() writes that the ship built to detain Americans is staying in port due to the presence of the [USS *Adams*]() and the [USS *Enterprise*](), and that Hajj Abdashaman Hashash (a Moroccan minister?) has promised to recommend discontinuation of hostilities toward America; Simpson did agree to let a Moroccan ship go to Tunis with wheat (3 August 1802)

### Reestablishment of peace
- BW2:226: [James Simpson]() receives a letter from Sidi Mahomet Ben Absalem Salawy, secretary of state of Morocco, 6 August 1802, reinstating the terms of their previous agreement--presents once a year, or if it is difficult to get to Morocco because of distance, every two years
    - Simpson is ordered to return to his house
    - Salawy maintains that the current unrest is entirely due to negligence by the Americans, but the emperor "now forgives all that"
- BW2:231: Simpson writes to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that as he has returned to his house and duties, Morris should "consider Peace restored," though there are a few details of the treaty left to be negotiated (12 August 1802)
- BW2:235-36: The path to peace is a bit rockier than Simpson expected: while negotiations are ongoing, Simpson suggests to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that he should leave the [USS *Adams*]() off Gibraltar, where it is available as a show of force and to salute with 13 guns when peace is officially re-established (16 August 1802)
- BW2:246: [Daniel Brent]() reports that the SecState's intention to send the gun carriages and a friendly letter to the emperor was countermanded by the heads of department (not quite sure whom this refers to), 31 August 1802
    - BW2:258: SecNav clarifies that these gun carriages were meant as a peace present to Morocco, and the declaration of war is what provoked the State Department to not send them (27 August 1802)
- BW2:263: Simpson writes to Salawy in response to an apparent request for another embassy (presents), stating that he is not aware of any stipulation in their treaty that would require such an embassy (1 September 1802)
- BW2:265: Morocco still wants a passport for the Tripolitan frigate at anchor in Gibraltar; Simpson writes that if the emperor decides to call the frigate Moroccan and request a passport, there's not a lot he can really do to resist that request and keep the peace (3 September 1802)
    - BW2:268: [Hugh G. Campbell]() ([USS *Adams*]()) reports that the emperor has indeed claimed the Tripolitan frigate and preparations are underway to send her to sea, as of August 27 (7 September 1802)
    - Campbell refused to grant a passport unless the emperor could produce vouchers that demonstrated that the frigate really belonged to Morocco
    - Campbell entreated Simpson to figure out what to do, as without a passport, which Campbell would not grant, he would be required to seize the frigate, which would undoubtedly lead to war with Morocco

## Meshouda
- BW2:275: Simpson and Campbell asked for voucher from the emperor of Morocco that the Tripolitan ship was actually his, and he gave it to them: " she carrys Our Victorious Flag, and goes on the fulfillment of Our Orders and intentions. - Let no one oppose her or hinder her, neither do her any Injury; and we Order all the Consuls to despatch her, and deliver their Passports."
