- Morocco also wants to do something about the ships blockaded at Gibraltar. The Emperor of Morocco requested that the ships be given a passport to go home. [Richard Dale]() writes to [James Simpson]() in response: "You will please to Inform the Governor of Tangier, that the U.S. did not make war against the Bey of Tripoli; the Bey of Tripoli made war against the U.S. without any caus what ever on the part of the United States it is the wish of the President, to be at peace, and in friendship, with all nations, But as the Bey of Tripoli has made war without any cause, it is my duty, to take and detain his corsairs where ever I find them, nor do I think the good Since of His Highness the Emperor of Morocco, will permitt him to think that I have done wrong in so doing" (BW2:78, 4 March 1802)
- [Richard Dale]() is still concerned about Morocco, though: he writes to [James Simpson]() that he should see the emperor of Morocco personally in order to "do away if possible those unjust Ideas that the Tripoline Ambassador has empressed on his mind, in favour of his Master, to the prejudice of the United States, ... it appears to me that the Emperor is desided in taking part with the Bey of Tripoli, how far he intends to go I cannot tell, it is very much, to be dreaded, his going to war with the United States, he can do us more Injury than all the other powers put together, therefore we must do every thing we can to keep peace with him" (BW2:81)
- [James Simpson]() writes to Sec of State that he has not taken the hard line Dale recommended with the emperor of Morocco, regarding the passports for the Tripolitan ship; instead, he has demurred by saying Dale did not have time to discuss it with the Swedish admiral before he was forced to return home, so the emperor would have to wait for a decision until Dale's successor arrived and could speak to [Soderstrom](). " At all events it certainly is Best, should the request be ultimately found such as cannot be granted? that Sweden join in the refusal, as it can do no good that the United States come forward alone with such, before Admiral Cederstroms sentiments be known." (BW2:92, 19 March 1802)
- BW2:114: SecNav informs [Richard Valentine Morris]() of the state of affairs with Morocco and requests, "We should be very much wanting in our duty, if these circumstances did not excite a precautionary vigilance with respect to the Emperor's movements. They may eventuate in an open declaration of hostilities which we ought to be seasonably prepared to meet. I request you therefore by all proper means, to inform yourself of all the Emperor's movements & do not fail to give me full and frequent information on the subject" (13 April 1802)

### War declaration

- BW2:186: Morocco declared war on USA on 19 April 1802: " When we consider how very trivial the object of sending some Cargoes of Wheat, to be distributed in Charity to the poor at Tripoly is, put in comparison with going to War with a Nation, it is scarce to be believed that the Emperour of Morocco would have adopted so serrious a measure for that only object"--hard to tell whether [James Simpson]() believes his own country at fault here or Morocco
    - Simpson decides to remain at Gibraltar to keep an eye on Morocco's ships
- BW2:190: [James Simpson]() receives a letter from the governor of Tangier inviting him to return to Tangier for 6 months; Simpson is not impressed by this offer: " Had this order arrived in time to prevent my expulsion, all would have been well; as in the time mentioned a negotiation might have been carried on, and any differences accommodated; but it appears to me since His Majesty saw fit to declare he was at War with the United States, and in consequence thereof to direct, that their Consul should be driven from his dominions, something beyond this Letter from a Governour will be highly necessary" (3 July 1802) 
    - Simpson decides he needs to consult with [Richard Valentine Morris]() before deciding whether to return to Tangier or not, though of course the [USS *Chesapeake*]() had just left on a cruise before Tripoli, so Simpson sends a letter with the [USS *Enterprise*]() asking to rendezvous with Morris as soon as possible (BW2:190, 3 July 1802)
- BW2:206: SecNav orders 100 gun carriages as present for the emperor of Morocco (20 July 1802)
- BW2:207: SecState reports that the emperor of Morocco has removed his request for passports to Tripoli, but that the president of the US has also granted passports for Moroccan vessels to travel to Tunis, 22 July 1802
    - Cultivating peace with Morocco seen as an incentive for Tripoli to make peace
- BW2:210: [James Simpson]() goes to Tangier to negotiate peace with Morocco; he also notes that the Moroccan frigate that has been being built is ready for launch and has been authorized to attack Americans (27 July 1802)
