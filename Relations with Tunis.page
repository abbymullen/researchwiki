## Demands for tribute
- List of presents to the bey of Tunis:
    - A gun mounted with a golden barrel and a mahogany crimson-velvet-lined case (L525)
    - Diamonds and emeralds for the gun (L345)
    - Pair of pistols, golden, with mahogany crimson-velvet-lined case (L525)
    - Diamonds and emeralds for the pistols (L212)
    - 5 mounted guns with embossing, etc., with mahogany crimson-velvet-lined case (L2100)
    - 5 Pairs of golden pistols, etc. (L2100)
    - (List provided by [Rufus King](), 15 March 1802, BW2:86)
- BW2:134: [William Eaton]() gets in a tiff with the bey of Tunis; the bey told Eaton to pack his bags, whereupon Eaton refused to grant any more passports for Tunisian vessels. The bey averred that he wanted peace, and that he did not think Eaton was as inclined toward peace as he was; "they must have a Consul with less fantasia & more friendly to the Barbary interests." Eaton replied that he was anticipating leaving very soon, and being replaced by [James Leander Cathcart](), but the bey said that Cathcart was not welcome in Tunis, 26 April 1802
- BW2:166: [Alexander Murray]() delivers the presents to [William Eaton]() for the bey of Tunis; they are accepted, but one Tunisian minister asks again for a corvette or brig of war; Eaton reminds the minister of the stipulations of their treaty, but also notes that if they pay Tripoli, then they will have to pay Tunis (6 June 1802)
- [James Leander Cathcart]() reports that the bey of Tunis wants the USA to join the "list of small Nations" like Sweden or Denmark, and also asked for a better consul, which Cathcart reads as a consul who will bow to all of the bey's wishes (11 June 1802, BW2:171)
    - Cathcart reflects on the disparity between how much France pays and how much the USA pays; the dishonor of not getting a salute when entering Tunis harbor; the likelihood that Tunis will want war but not while the American squadron is around.
    - Cathcart states that the British and French, who maintain consuls in the Barbary states without regard to whether they are welcome, are the model the USA should follow, rather than the model of a 'small christian nation' who changes consuls at the whim of the Barbary ruler; changing at the request of the ruler sets a precedent for dishonor in other areas
- BW2:269: Bey of Tunis writes directly to [Thomas Jefferson](), thanking him for the presents of jewels and stores, but then demanding a 36-gun frigate of war. He says that since [William Eaton]() declined to pass along this request, he was writing to Jefferson personally in hopes of receiving this gift to "cement the ties of our friendship" (8 September 1802)
- BW3:4-5: Summary of negotiations with Tunis, the upshot of which was the bey wanted a frigate and the United States wanted to give cash, and that [James Leander Cathcart]() would not be received there as consul (September 1803)

## Disputes over captured vessels

- BW2:142-43: [William Eaton]() clashed with the bey over 4 Tunisian coastal vessels that were captured by an American frigate
    -  "The Bey asserted a right to carry provisions in all eases to his brethren - I denied its application to U States, by saying, that if this principle were established between him and his brethren, it did not extend to those who were not included in that relation. He quoted the Venitiene in the war with him - I told him we did not admit them as authority, and quoted examples of the English and French - He asserted the principle of free bottoms free goods - I answered that this principle was never construed to extend to a blockaded port. He referred to the President's Letter to him of 9th Sep. last, and inferred from it an implied order to respect his flag, Vessels and Subjects in all Situations - I did not suppose this construction would bear, and that a fair construction could only imply that respect so long as he or his Subjects respected the laws of neutrality - I had given seasonable and formal advise of the blockade of Tripoli: if, after this, he permitted bis subjects to carry provisions to that port it was taking the responsibility on himself - if they took these enterprizes without his consent, it was a voluntary risque on their part and they had no reason to complain in case of capture - But the captures being made agreeably to acknowledged maxims of war were of course good prize to the Captors, and were undoubtedly before this moment, dlsposed of as such, reclamations therefore on the Commandant would avail nothing" (4 May 1802) (See also [International law]().)
    -  "Whatever restitution may be in future conceded, this is not the moment to yield in the smallest matter that will go to deminish that opinion of our energy with which these pirates begin to be impressed - It will be Seasonable enough to be generous when they shall be taught to appreciate duly our generosity" 
- BW2:344-45: [William Eaton]() writes to [Richard Valentine Morris]() about the capture of the imperial vessel *Paulina* (by the [USS *Enterprise*]()) and the ensuing dispute with the bey of Tunis (26 January 1803)
    - The bey threatens to start attacking American ships in retaliation
    - Eaton reminds the bey that Tripoli is under blockade, so the USA has every right to capture ships heading there
    - The bey says he does not acknowledge the law of nations in terms of blockade
    - Eaton says he has to talk to the commodore at the very least before any decisions can be made
- BW2:353: The papers about the ownership of the *Paulina* and its cargo are laid in front of the bey of Tunis as well as [Richard Valentine Morris](); Morris "promised its restitution" and the agent of the ship-owner promised not to make any further claims; "we flattered ourselves that the appearance of the Squadron in this Bay had tranquilized our affairs with this Regency for some time" (giving meat to the opinions of Cathcart and Eaton about the efficacy of showing force in the Barbary states) (2 March 1803) (see also [Use of force]()) 
    - Despite the agent's promise not to make any more claims, he returned the next day and the day after to make additional claims that he insisted had been mentioned during the commodore's meeting (including 1/2 of 47 casks of raisins)
    - "[[James Leander Cathcart]()] lost all patience at so barefaced a falsehood, called him an impostor destitute of shame, he went away in a Pet, and the Commodore in order to prevent detention thought proper to accede to his demand, however unjust, and to prevent a repetition, determined to embark immediately, he having previously intended to take leave of the Bashaw, as is customary when a Public Officer leaves this Country" 

## Affronts to national honor and custom
- See also [Conduct of naval ships]()
- 12 September 1802: Bey tells [William Eaton]() to tell the commander of the [USS *Constellation*]() that he must come to shore to pay his respects; Eaton tells him that he will instruct the commander to do so only once the bey treats the ships of the American squadron with the proper respect due to neutral nations (BW2:272-73)
- 22 February 1803: [James Leander Cathcart]() records that [William Eaton]() came on board with Cathcart and gave them an idea how relations stood with Tunis: "The whole of which tended To prove the great utility the appearance of the Squadron would be to our affairs with this Regency, and to impress the Commodore with the Idea that a personal interview with the Bashaw, would be expected, and was absolutely necessary; as none of the Commanders in Chief of our Squadron had ever paid him that Compliment." (BW2:351) 
- 4 March 1803: [Richard Valentine Morris]() intends to leave Tunis, but is brought back by an agent who claims that a debt owed by [William Eaton]() of $34,000 would be paid by the commodore; this discussion turns into a multiple-day dispute that ranges from accusations about Eaton's debts to a general rant about the hypocrisy of the Barbary rulers in their treatment of [James Leander Cathcart](); eventually the agent and the bey ordered Eaton to leave Tunis, and everyone departed (BW2:354)
- 3 September 1803: [USS *Adams*]() brings [James Leander Cathcart]() to Tunis, where he is supposed to be negotiating; "In the course of conversation, Captain Campbell declared, that he had no business to transact on shore, nor had He any desire to see Tunis; and that He would consequently remain on board, Doctor Davis said, the Bashaw would be displeased if the customary visit was not paid him; that He was extremely particular in the etiquette of his Court; that the Officers of all Ships of War paid his Excellency that compliment; and that it would be expected from us; that as no difficulty existed, there was nothing to be apprehended; and that He would forfeit his Life and reputation, if any impediment was placed in the way of his departure, when ever He pleased. I joined in Doctor Davis's request, believing what He said; and Capt: Campbell acquiesced, saying if He could be of any service, He would go, though much against His will." (BW3:4)


## Tactics for dealing with the bey
- [William Eaton]() laments that no rational means of entreaty will get through to the bey, and therefore he must again resort to the denial of passports for Tunisian cruisers (BW2:359, 8 February 1803)
    - This move brings an agent of the bey to him to discuss the problem, where Eaton reminds the bey that he has threatened to send cruisers out to attack American shipping, and Eaton won't grant passports for ships who will do that
    - Eaton also sort of promises the bey a sloop of war, which causes the bey to send out his cruisers for Swedish shipping instead of American
    - Sweden had previously come to a compromise with the bey and so the Swedish consul thought the Tunisians were going after the Americans; Eaton writes, "I know he supposes the expedition intended against Americans, and exults with himself on his intrigue and adroitness in having influenced its direction. But the reflection impresses itself nevertheless forcibly, that the Commercial policy of Christian Courts, which imposes the duty of this cruel intrigue on their Agents, is most cowardly and wicked!"
    - Eaton continues to circle the ring with the bey; "It results from these late events that this Pirate is cautious of prowling among our merchantmen while he apprehends our Ships of war on the watch; that we shall neither have peace nor an open rupture here the ensuing season, as has been the case the last; that his resolution to persevere in forcing a commerce to Tripoli will, most probably, eventually augment his hat of reclamations: and that he will sieze a moment when we are off our guard,as was the case with the Danes and is actually the case with the Swedes, to insult our flag under a pretext of seeking indemnity" (BW2:360)

## Opinions about the relationship
- BW2:384: [Richard Valentine Morris]() believes that a rupture between Tunis and the United States is likely, considering that the "Northern Powers" (Scandinavia?) have agreed to his terms rather than fight, but the USA will not agree to his terms (30 March 1803)
