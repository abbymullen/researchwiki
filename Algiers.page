## Politics of Algiers
- Algiers was a republic of sorts: "According to the Abbé Poiret, whereas Tunis was “a monarchical state which passes directly from father to son, Algeria is a republic whose elected government is extremely tumultuous. When the moment comes to name a new dey, the regency, composed of the chief commanders of the militia, meets to carry out the election, which usually nominates one of the chief ministers. . . . But if some other person has formed a powerful party among the troops, and if he has enough courage to assassinate the dey and replace him on the throne, the sovereign authority rests in his hands until someone equally audacious wrests it from him by the same means.”3 (Coller 67)
