## Tribute payments as dishonorable
- BW1:358: [William Eaton]() to Sec of State, 23 June 1800: "Nobody here, acquainted with our concessions, could be persuaded that we are the same Americans who, twenty years ago, braved the resentment of Great Britain, if that fact were not recorded. There is, indeed, no nation so much humiliated in matters of tribute - And it is a burlesque upon every thing manly or political to see nations pouring into the ports of these kingdoms, which have not of their own produce a single article of naval material, stores and builders to construct navies to be employed as pirates against themselves - In this list of inconsentents the U States at present have the honor to stand at the head"
- BW2:192: [Alexander Murray]() identifies the source of the dishonor: "I beleive might be brought down to very moderate terms, as it seems merely to keep up an old custom, never to make Peace mthout a bribe, how far our Republican pride will accede to such terms, tis not for me to conjecture" (5 July 1802)
- BW2:196-7: [William Eaton]() makes no bones: "this mode of carrying on the war will not do: Let our fellow Citizens be persuaded, before it be too late that except more energy be thrown into our operations, we risque to play a farce here, which in its progress will entrain the most disgraceful and the most inhuman sacrifices: our property captured and sold without the most distant prospect of indemnity - and our Citizens dragged to Slavery and goaded to a lingering death under the bastinade of merciless robbers. And, what is still more humiliating, after all this we shall be compelled to purchase a peace on the terms of an unprincipled, overbearing Bashaw of a wretched dog-kennel, without at all remedying the evil - If America can yield to this, and look the world in the face without a blush, let her blot the stars from her escutcheon and viel with sack-cloth the sun of her former glory" (9 July 1802)
- BW2:393: [Richard O'Brien]() called the French payments of stores and supplies to Algiers "a shamefull business" (19 April 1803)

## *George Washington*'s journey
- BW1:366: Sec of Navy to [William Bainbridge](), 31 July 1800: "You should on your arrival before Algiers, send an Officer on shore with the letter to M: OBrien, whose advice you will follow on the subject of saluting the city, and every other matter, not degrading to yourself, or the flag of the U. States."
- BW1:378: ship's journal, 9 October 1800: When the decision had been made to fly the Algerine flag on the ship's journey to Constantinople, "some tears fell at this Instance of national Humility."
- BW1:379: [William Bainbridge]() to Sec of Navy, 10 October 1800: "Had we 10 or 12 frigates and sloops in those seas, I am well convinced in my own mind that we should not experience those mortifying degradations that must be cutting to every American who possesses an independent spirit."
- BW1:398: [William Eaton]() to Sec of State, 11 November 1800: "Genius of My Country! How art thou prostrate! Hast thou not yet one son whose soul revolts, whose nerves convulse, blood vessels burst, and heart indignant swells at thoughts of such debasement! Shade of Washington! Behold thy orphan'd sword hang on a slave - A voluntary slave, and serve a pirate! I never thought to find a corner of this slanderous world where baseness and American were wedded - But here we are the by word of derision; quoted as precedents of baseness - even by a Dane! Shall Tunis also lift his thievish arm, smite our scarred cheek, then bid us kiss the rod! This is the price of peace! But if we will have peace at such a price, recall me, and send a slave, accustomed to abasement, to represent the nation - And furnish ships of war, and funds and slaves to his support, and Our immortal shame - History shall tell that The United States first volunteer'd a ship of war, equipt, a carrier for a pirate - It is written - Nothing but blood can blot the impression out - Frankly I own, I would have lost the peace, and been empaled myself rather than yielded this concession - Will nothing rouse my country!"

## Honor in the Barbary States
- BW1:431: [William Eaton]() to Sec of State, 10 April 1801: "This Highwayman [the bey of Tunis] is much the most Gentlemanlike of the three. He seldom robs a man without first creating a pretext. He has some ideas of justice and not wholly destitute of a sense of shame. He is vain of the notions of integrity and honor which he imagines the nations accord to him - and in this point he is vulnerable."
- BW1:545: [James Leander Cathcart]() does not have a high opinion of the bashaw's honor: "the Bashaw like Satan only flatters to deceive & is destitute of every honourable sentiment which dignifies the human heart"
- BW2:74: [John Shaw]() thinks the Algerines would try to capture him in harbor if they could: "if -- taken at sea. it -- would be only fair play -- but the[y] are a people of no confidence or honor and ever ready to deceive there Nearest Friend" (2 March 1802)
- BW2:279: [William Eaton]() writes to [Yusuf Karamanli]() to remind him of his promise of prisoner exchange: " We cannot consider this accident as a great misfortune, because it furnishes an opportunity of demonstrating to the American government the full reliance they may place on the good faith and magnanimity of your Exy in regarding and sacredly fu[l]filling all promises voluntarily made - We will not doubt therefore that the Americans are ahead set at liberty in faith of that agreement; or, if they are still at Tripoli, that your Exy does consider them as free citizens of the U States, and not as prisoners of war; as, placing full reliance on your Exy's tiskery we do also consider them" (18 September 1802)
- BW3:6: [James Leander Cathcart]() laments: "To what a degrading situation are we reduced! the Commanders of the very Squadron which is sent out to preserve the Honor of our Nation and dignity of our Flag cannot land as the Officers of all other Nations do, and depart unmolested; but have twice, in the small period of Six Months been subjected to arrest; and at this moment it would be the heighth of imprudence to land at Tunis, as certain arrest maybe imprisonment, would be the consequence" (7 September 1803)

## Honor in sending a squadron
- BW1:545: [James Leander Cathcart]() sees squadron's activities as the moral and honorable way to deal with the problem: "We have every opportunity of inspiring those Barbarians with an Idea that we have not sued for peace through impressions of fear & that we will not suffer our Flag to be insulted with impunity."
- BW1:563: No peace without honor: "the United States wishes to be at Peace with all Nations but She Will not suffer her Flag to be Insulted by any Nation." ([Richard Dale]())
- BW1:572: Honor is important to the European community: "Your idea of bombarding the Town is an excellent one, the eyes of all Europe is upon your little Squadron, & I am certain they will reflect honor upon their Country & justify the idea already formed of American valor & intrepidity" ([James Leander Cathcart](), 7 September 1801)
- BW1:584: [Newton Keene](), 22 September 1801, argues that treating the Tripolitans with civility only gives them a chance to transgress again: "if our Government expects to Command respectability to their Flag by Sending their Ships of War, across an Ocean of Four thousand miles & giving their Commanders Instructions to Treat all Pirats who may fall in their Hands with all the Humanity of the more Civilized nations the ends for which they are Sent will not be accomplished & our Navy as well as Government (in my opinion) will sink lnto Contempt."
    - Contra [Secretary of the Navy]() to [Daniel McNeill](), 1 October 1801: "Any Prisoners you may take, you will treat with humanity & attention, and land them on the Barbary Shore. This Mode will be humane; and will tend to bring those powers back to a Sense of Justice. You will be careful to select from them, such Christians as may be on board, whom you will treat kindly and land them when convenient on some Christian Shore, or if you should have occasion, you may accept their Services." (BW1:588) 
- Squadron as chance to establish USA: [Richard Dale]() to [David Humphreys](), 28 October 1801, " There never was, nor will there be again, for some time to come so favourable an oppertunity for the U. S. to Establish a lasting reputation, for its flag in those seas" (BW1:611).
- [William Eaton](), contra [Alexander Murray](), defends his strategy idea of a coup in Tripoli, rather than relying on the blockade, which Eaton argues is so poor as to be virtually pointless: " To me this appears the moment to fix our reputation in the view of these piratical States - We should not be inwerent to it in the view of the world. If the occasion be suffered to be lost the disadvantages will be incalculable" (8 June 1802, BW2:169)

## Specific acts of honor/dishonor
- See also [Death by violence]().
- [Richard Dale]() considers the dishonor of the behavior of the governor of St. Roque, 28 October 1801: BW1:611: "I cannot suppose that the King of Spain knows of the disrespect that is paid to our flag by a number of his Officers, If he dos know it & dos not put a stop to it, we may expect in a Very short time Very serious consiquences, between the parties for my part, I shall act as I have told the Commander in Chief in my letter to him, I can never submit to see the flag of my Country Insulted in that way without resenting it, while I have the Honor to hold the present post or any other under it." 
    - When the governor takes umbrage at some of the phrases Dale used in his complaint, Dale replies: "I wish your excellency to conceive that the United States of America, will not consider an insult, with Impunity from any Nation." (BW1:612)
- [James Leander Cathcart]() feels that the American flag is being disrespected at Leghorn in the enforcement of quarantine regulations: "Mr. Appleton & myself are taking measures to prevent similar abuses in future, & in order to insure that respect which is due our flag in this river of thieves." (BW1:626, 24 November 1801)
- [Richard Dale]() wants to know from the Commandant of Marine at Toulon "if I salute the City if it will be returned with an equal number of Guns" (7 December 1801, BW1:628)
- Honor sometimes has to bow to pragmatism: [Richard Dale](), 9 December 1801: "I am put in Quarantine for 15 Days, I am sorry 1 cannot say any thing favourable of my reception in this place as yet, two Men as a guard is put on Board, to see there is no improper conduct, while in Quarantine, My feelings as an Officer, Commanding a Ship of War, belonging to the United States, is Very much hurt, those men cannot suppose, that I have much respect for the Honor of my Country - or that we have no Honor at all, to suppose, that I would suffer there Quarantine laws to be Violated, I sent the men on shore - they were sent back, I was informed, if I did not permitt them to remain on Board, I could have no supplys from the shore, - Had I not been situated as I am, at present, I certainly would have left the port without loss of time." (BW1:631)
- Deceit is dishonorable: [Daniel McNeill]() lies to the quarantine officer at Toulon about where in the Mediterranean he had touched -- "nothing should tempt a man to deviate from the truth in his report to a Health office . . . a deviation from the truth, in a man of the above description tends in some measure to tarnish not only his owne Honor, but that of his Country and brother officers," writes [Richard Dale]() (BW2:28)
- BW2:306: [William Eaton]() thinks Sweden has sold out by allowing France to broker a treaty for them with Tripoli: "The french Commissary General tells me, "The Swedish Admiral acknowledges that the mediation of the french Embassador at Tripoli has saved his nation a hundred thousand dollars!" He might have added - But the national honor and independence of Sweden are thrown into the scale to balance the obligation!" (22 October 1802) 

## Rank and seniority

The assigning of rank and seniority caused many problems in the Navy; a seniority ranking lower than expected could provoke some officers into sending in their resignation rather than accept the lower seniority.

- [Isaac Hull]() did this at first; SecNav responded: "I know what the feelings of military Men are, and that among them there always exista a jealousy on the subject of rank: this jealousy is by no means an improper one, but it sometimes leads men into hasty & intemperate decisions, incompatible with their own honor." (3 May 1802, BW2:141)
- [John Rodgers]() is affronted that [Edward Preble]() is flying the commodore's pennant when Rodgers is the more senior officer: "this is not an affair between private individuds, and that my feelings as an o ar has been most sensibly injured, and I do (also) insist that if the Date of your Commission is subsequent to mine, that it is not in the power (Even) of the Government, to place you or any other Officer in a situation which could afford an opportunity of treating me with Disrespect. - It would give me pain to leave the Mediterranean on unfriendly terms with you, but there are certain points of Etiquette which I can not in justice to myself pass over and which you have not explained" (BW3:47, 15 September 1803)

## Zeal for the task
- BW2:423: [Edward Preble]() assures SecNav of his zeal for the leadership of the squadron (it's almost as if he knew [Richard Valentine Morris]() had been a disappointment): "I am fully aware of the great trust, and high responsibility connected with this appointment, and altho I may err in judgment from a want of talents and experience, for so important Station, yet he may rest assured that I never shall from a want of Zeal for the Public service. The honor of the American Flag is very dear to me, and I hope it will never be tarnished under my command" (27 May 1803) 
- BW2:476: SecNav writes to [Edward Preble](): "The conduct for some time past pursued by our squadron in the Mediterranean, has, unhappily, not been calculated to accomplish the object of government nor to make a just impression on the Enemy of our national character. We have therefore transferred to you the command of our forces in that sea, in full confidence that you will maintain the dignity of your station and that the FLAG of your country will not be dishonored in your hands" (13 July 1803) 
- [William Eaton]() to [James Madison](), 18 September 1804: "The impressions, which the activity of Commodore Preble’s squadron has stamped on the coast of Barbary, have pretty effectually erased those sentiments of contempt for our arms which the dilatory movements of his predecessor had left on the minds, as well of the enemy as the other regencies.
As it concerns my individual interest I shall never cease to have peculiar cause to regret that such an officer had not sooner commanded in this sea; but he has left the field so fair for vigorous and decisive operations that the termination of the war may prove more honorable to the United States than if it had become less an object of general speculation."
