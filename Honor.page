## Tribute payments as dishonorable
- BW1:358: [William Eaton]() to Sec of State, 23 June 1800: "Nobody here, acquainted with our concessions, could be persuaded that we are the same Americans who, twenty years ago, braved the resentment of Great Britain, if that fact were not recorded. There is, indeed, no nation so much humiliated in matters of tribute - And it is a burlesque upon every thing manly or political to see nations pouring into the ports of these kingdoms, which have not of their own produce a single article of naval material, stores and builders to construct navies to be employed as pirates against themselves - In this list of inconsentents the U States at present have the honor to stand at the head"

## *George Washington*'s journey
- BW1:366: Sec of Navy to [William Bainbridge](), 31 July 1800: "You should on your arrival before Algiers, send an Officer on shore with the letter to M: OBrien, whose advice you will follow on the subject of saluting the city, and every other matter, not degrading to yourself, or the flag of the U. States."
- BW1:378: ship's journal, 9 October 1800: When the decision had been made to fly the Algerine flag on the ship's journey to Constantinople, "some tears fell at this Instance of national Humility."
- BW1:379: [William Bainbridge]() to Sec of Navy, 10 October 1800: "Had we 10 or 12 frigates and sloops in those seas, I am well convinced in my own mind that we should not experience those mortifying degradations that must be cutting to every American who possesses an independent spirit."
- BW1:398: [William Eaton]() to Sec of State, 11 November 1800: "Genius of My Country! How art thou prostrate! Hast thou not yet one son whose soul revolts, whose nerves convulse, blood vessels burst, and heart indignant swells at thoughts of such debasement! Shade of Washington! Behold thy orphan'd sword hang on a slave - A voluntary slave, and serve a pirate! I never thought to find a corner of this slanderous world where baseness and American were wedded - But here we are the by word of derision; quoted as precedents of baseness - even by a Dane! Shall Tunis also lift his thievish arm, smite our scarred cheek, then bid us kiss the rod! This is the price of peace! But if we will have peace at such a price, recall me, and send a slave, accustomed to abasement, to represent the nation - And furnish ships of war, and funds and slaves to his support, and Our immortal shame - History shall tell that The United States first volunteer'd a ship of war, equipt, a carrier for a pirate - It is written - Nothing but blood can blot the impression out - Frankly I own, I would have lost the peace, and been empaled myself rather than yielded this concession - Will nothing rouse my country!"

## Honor in the Barbary States
- BW1:431: [William Eaton]() to Sec of State, 10 April 1801: "This Highwayman [the bey of Tunis] is much the most Gentlemanlike of the three. He seldom robs a man without first creating a pretext. He has some ideas of justice and not wholly destitute of a sense of shame. He is vain of the notions of integrity and honor which he imagines the nations accord to him - and in this point he is vulnerable."
- BW1:545: [James Leander Cathcart]() does not have a high opinion of the bashaw's honor: "the Bashaw like Satan only flatters to deceive & is destitute of every honourable sentiment which dignifies the human heart"

## Honor in sending a squadron
- BW1:545: [James Leander Cathcart]() sees squadron's activities as the moral and honorable way to deal with the problem: "We have every opportunity of inspiring those Barbarians with an Idea that we have not sued for peace through impressions of fear & that we will not suffer our Flag to be insulted with impunity."
- BW1:563: No peace without honor: "the United States wishes to be at Peace with all Nations but She Will not suffer her Flag to be Insulted by any Nation." ([Richard Dale]())
- BW1:572: Honor is important to the European community: "Your idea of bombarding the Town is an excellent one, the eyes of all Europe is upon your little Squadron, & I am certain they will reflect honor upon their Country & justify the idea already formed of American valor & intrepidity" ([James Leander Cathcart](), 7 September 1801)
