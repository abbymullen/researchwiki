Commodore: Richard Valentine Morris

#### Ships
- [USS *Chesapeake*](): [Richard Valentine Morris]()
- [USS *Constellation*](): [Alexander Murray]()
- [USS *Adams*](): [Edward Preble]()
- [USS *Enterprize*](): [Andrew Sterett]()
- [USS *New York*](): sent as reinforcements because of potential trouble with Morocco
- [USS *John Adams*](): sent as reinforcements because of potential trouble with Morocco

#### Notable things
- This is the first cruise after the US government declares war and gives full authority to the navy to wage war
    - [William Eaton]() thinks that this declaration will produce a drastic change in how the Americans will fight: " We have therefore a well grounded reason to hope that our operations this summer will be decisive" (BW2:158, 21 May 1802)
- [Alexander Murray]() is given command of the squadron until Morris can arrive; he wastes no time issuing orders and making his presence known---castigating [William Eaton]() for waste of public funds; sending ships home or to different stations
