#### Notable things
- This is the first cruise after the US government declares war and gives full authority to the navy to wage war
    - [William Eaton]() thinks that this declaration will produce a drastic change in how the Americans will fight: " We have therefore a well grounded reason to hope that our operations this summer will be decisive" (BW2:158, 21 May 1802)
- [Alexander Murray]() is given command of the squadron until Morris can arrive; he wastes no time issuing orders and making his presence known---castigating [William Eaton]() for waste of public funds; sending ships home or to different stations
- [Richard Valentine Morris]() writes: "You may rest assured, Sir, that every exertion on my part shall be made, to place the United States on friendly terms with these powers, and in the event of war, that all possible means shall be used to preserve the dignity of our nation, and protect the commerce of our country" (BW2:297, 15 October 1802) 
- BW2:526-531: Summation of cruise, as evidence against Richard Valentine Morris
- 16 June 1803: [Thomas Jefferson]() writes to SecNav: "I am of opinion, and suggest it for your consideration, that an order of recall to Capt Morris should go by the Nautilus. from his inactivity hitherto, I have no expectation that any thing will be done against Tripoli by the frigates in the Mediterranean while under his command. if he is recalled by the Nautilus, and the command devolves on the others, we shall gain six weeks at least in the best season, for whatever they can effect in that time against the enemy" (TJ,  http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/founders/TSJN-01-40-02-0412 [accessed 25 Oct 2016])
- [Henry Wadsworth]() seems astonished when [Richard Valentine Morris]() is ordered home--perhaps he thought everything was going well? "We learn! Strange to tell!!! We learn that the Commodore is order'd home" (BW3:30; 12 September 1803)

## Cruise 3
- **Important**: Preble's cruise was different from the others in that it was primarily made up of lighter ships; fewer frigates. In other words, the navy department was genuinely trying to follow the advice given by the previous commanders and diplomats.
- Resume of ships: BW3:11-12
- BW2:414: [Edward Preble]() reports that the [USS *Constitution*]() needs to be heaved down and thus won't be ready for another 7 or 8 weeks, 22 May 1803
- BW2:420: [USS *Philadelphia*]() delayed in getting to sea for want of spars (24 May 1803)
- Squadron: Commodore [Edward Preble]() in [USS *Constitution*]()
    - [USS *Philadelphia*](): [William Bainbridge]()
    - [USS *Siren*](): [Charles Stewart]()
    - [USS *Argus*](): [Isaac Hull]()
    - [USS *Vixen*](): [John Smith]()
    - [USS *Nautilus*](): [Richard Somers]()
    - [USS *Enterprise*](): [Stephen Decatur]()
- Orders (BW2:474-75):
    - "subdue, seize, and make prize of, all Vessels, Goods and Effects belonging to the Bey of Tripoli or to his subjects"
    - "The varying aspects of our affairs in the Mediterranean - the great distance between this country and the probable places of your operations, render it improper for the government to prescribe to you any particular course of conduct. We therefore leave you unrestrained in your movements and at liberty to pursue the dictates of your own judgment subject however to the following general regulations and instructions."
    - "you will without intermission maintain during the season in which it may be safely done, an effectual blockade of Tripoli, & that you will by all the means in your power annoy the Enemy and it is submitted to you whether during such blockade it would not be advisable to keep some of your squadron cruising off Cape Bonn. It is however proper to state to you that no place is to be considered by you in a state of blockade which is not actually besieged." <-- key piece of information here; this matters for the legality of captures
