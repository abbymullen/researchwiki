## Cruise 1


## Cruise 2

Commodore: Richard Valentine Morris

#### Ships
- [USS *Chesapeake*](): [Richard Valentine Morris]()
- [USS *Constellation*](): [Alexander Murray]()
- [USS *Adams*](): [Edward Preble]()

- [USS *John Adams*](): sent as reinforcements because of potential trouble with Morocco

#### Notable things
- This is the first cruise after the US government declares war and gives full authority to the navy to wage war
    - [William Eaton]() thinks that this declaration will produce a drastic change in how the Americans will fight: " We have therefore a well grounded reason to hope that our operations this summer will be decisive" (BW2:158, 21 May 1802)
- [Alexander Murray]() is given command of the squadron until Morris can arrive; he wastes no time issuing orders and making his presence known---castigating [William Eaton]() for waste of public funds; sending ships home or to different stations
- [Richard Valentine Morris]() writes: "You may rest assured, Sir, that every exertion on my part shall be made, to place the United States on friendly terms with these powers, and in the event of war, that all possible means shall be used to preserve the dignity of our nation, and protect the commerce of our country" (BW2:297, 15 October 1802)
