This ship, captained by [Joseph Bounds](), was hired by [William Eaton]() as part of his plan for a [Coup in Tripoli](). [Alexander Murray]() disapproved of the plan, including the hiring of the *Gloria*, and tried to dismiss the ship. Eaton fought back and continued to use the *Gloria* as a dispatch vessel and transport.

- Uncertain when the *Gloria* first came into public service; it seems like it might have been very early? [Thomas Jefferson]() writes on 28 August 1801: "I have read Eaton’s correspondence, and form a very respectable opinion of his understanding. I should be disposed to do so too of his honesty: but how, to these two qualities, can we reconcile his extraordinary mission of this vessel?" Is he referring to the *Gloria* here?
