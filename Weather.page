## In the Mediterranean

Weather was a significant factor in whether or not American naval vessels were on station in the blockade.

- BW2:15: [Samuel Barron]() reports that stormy weather destroyed many vessels at Malta in late December 1801, including rudder and sail damage to several British naval vessels (including a 74)
    - "in fact such a winter has never been known before and I suppose has kept in our Tripoline friends" 

- BW2:18: Lt. [John Shaw]() bullies the Neapolitan authorities into letting him into the harbor because the weather is so poor that he feels his ship will be broken up if it can't get into the harbor (11 January 1802)

- BW2:79: [USS *Constellation*]() unable to get over the bar at New Castle because of bad weather; delayed by several days and lost cables and anchor, 7 March 1802
    - [Alexander Murray]() writes that the bad weather has also caused 50 men to be on the sick list because of exposure to the cold and wet, with 2 dead
    
- BW2:116: [USS *President*]() delayed for at least 10 days in Gibraltar because of headwinds, till 10 March 1802

- BW2:139: [USS *Constellation*]() delayed---took 12 days to go 2/3 of the way to Gibraltar, and then 4 weeks to go the remaining 1/3; the wind was so heavy at Gibraltar that [Alexander Murray]() believed the ship to be in danger if it moored there, so went to Malaga instead, 30 April 1802
    - BW2:139: Murray writes to [William Kirkpatrick]() that his inability to stop in at Gibraltar means he has had no contact with the squadron (see [Communications]())

- BW2:203: [USS *Essex*](), 14 July 1802, records a storm that carried away "Main top mast, main & fore top gallt yards & split Main top gallt mast. Jno Bradley & Jno Weyant
seamen went overboard with the rigging & were lost." (See also [Physical accidents to ships or persons]().) 
- BW2:296: [Richard Valentine Morris]() notes that the passage from the United States to the Mediterranean took 55 days, and then having to stay in Gibraltar to sort things with Morocco, pushed the [USS *Chesapeake*]() to the place where it was almost pointless to head for Tripoli. He says he will go, but that November and December are not months that are safe for the American squadron to be out on station (15 October 1802)
    - Facts seem to bear out his concern: He records that he could not get out of Malta for several days at the end of December 1802 because of wind; he could not approach Tripoli at all; instead, it took him more than two weeks to get from Malta to Tunis, arriving on 22 January 1803
- BW2:343: It takes almost two weeks for [Alexander Murray]() to cross from Gibraltar to Tangier because of storms in the straits; he escapes being driven on shore, though, unlike 14 other vessels (11 January 1803)
    - He never actually makes it to Tangier, calling instead at Tetuan; after trying to get to Tangier a few more times, he gives up and goes home rather than collecting the dispatches he intended to (BW2:373)
- BW2:356: [Henry Wadsworth]() records that " it has been a continual gale: The Deck directly over my Cot leaks very much, of course my bed & bedding are much wet as the Element water is continually in boisterous weather washing over the Gun Deck: at 12 my Friend Cram will turn out to keep his watch when I will turn into his Cot which hangs in a dry place: As for me being officer of the Signals- I keep no watch, which I assure is very agreeable as we expect much Stormy & Tempestuous weather during our Cruize off Tripoly, whither we are bound" (31 January 1803)
- BW2:521: Two sailors on board the [USS *John Adams*]() are slightly injured by a "thunderbolt"--ship struck by lightning? (27 August 1803)
- BW3:50: [Edward Preble]() to [William Bainbridge](): "As soon as the Season makes it dangerous to cruise on the Coast of Tripoli you may harbor at Malta until you hear from me, or until it is the proper weather for cruising" (15 September 1803)
- BW3:65: [Edward Preble]() orders [Charles Stewart]() to cruise off Tripoli until the weather turns bad; "I do expect that you do go out occasionally and shew yourself off Tripoli even in that season when the Weather is most severe, as it will have a good effect." (19 September 1803)
- BW3:71: [Edward Preble](): "Adverse winds keeps me from Tanger Bay. I am endeavouring to reach it, but I find it hard striving against wind & Current" (22 September 1803)
- BW3:86: [Edward Preble]() provides assistance to an English brig, HMS Childers, a dispatch ship for England with letters from Lord Nelson, when a sudden squall carried away its topmasts (21 September 1803)
- BW3:97: Weather has effects on land as well: [James Simpson]() records the emperor's difficulty in getting back to Tangier: "The excessive bad Weather has delayed his Journey exceedingly, on Friday my Express found him encamped at a short distance on the other side of Alcassar River, and Hashash on this side of it, but their communication perfectly cut off the River being im assable, but on Rafts supported by Goat Skins filled with Wind." (2 October 1803) 

## In America
- BW2:502: Both the [USS *Constitution*]() and the [USS *Argus*]() are delayed in preparations because of rain, 1 August 1803
