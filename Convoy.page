One of the important but boring duties of the American squadron was to convoy American merchant vessels to and from ports in the Mediterranean. This of course took ships away from blockade duty.

"It was requisite That the Essex should convoy out of this sea. The american Vessels so long detained on acct of the Threatenings of Tripoli and The Snarlings of Algiers--& murmors of Tunis." --[Richard O'Brien]() to Secretary of State, September 26, 1801 (BW1:582)

## System
- Regulations about convoy, BW2:39-40

- Anywhere from 5-10 ships to hundreds could be part of a convoy. Typical American convoys were on the smaller side, as the Americans didn't have enough ships to support the larger ones.

- 1801: [USS Philadelphia]() convoys 10 American ships and 5 Swedish ships from Malaga to Alicant, Leghorn, and Naples (BW1:632)
- 1801: Circular warns ships against traveling in the Adriatic without convoy

- After Congress gives permission to capture and make prize of Tripolitan ships, the Secretary of the Navy again reminds the navy that they still have a duty to convoy, and specifically to convoy as large a group as possible at a time (BW2:51)

- BW2:189-90: [James Leander Cathcart]() wants to know whether consuls have the authority to force commercial vessels to accept convoy (in response to Morocco's declaration of war), or whether they can only advise commercial vessels to wait for convoy, 2 July 1802

- BW2:205: [James Leander Cathcart]() again laments US merchants' unwillingness to wait: "Mr Appleton & myself endeavor'd to dissuade the
Masters of vessels now in port from sailing until some of our Frigates
or those of Sweden arrives to take them under convoy, but without
effect, they seem at present as they ever have seem'd, intent upon gain only, without properly appreciating the risque, they have ever
been duly forewarn'd of their danger when any existed, if afterwards
they chose to precipitate themselves & crews to destruction regardless of their liberty & the national consequences of their capture, I hope
they will do the Agents of the United States the Justice at least to
own that we have been indefatigable in giving them timely information
in order to prevent them from rushing inconsiderately upon ruin &
what is worse, Slavery", 15 July 1802

## Irritations and delays
### Lack of ships to perform duty
- BW1:593: [Richard Dale]() to [William Kirkpatrick](): "it is my wish and Intention to give protection to all American Vessels, Either bound up the Mediterranean or down, as much, as in my Power lays, but the Commanders must have patience, I have to observe to you there is only three Ships of War in those seas at present belonging to the United States, one of them must be kept in or about this place, one off and about Tripoli so you see there is only one to go on the convoy Business."

### Difficulty of wrangling merchants
- BW1:615: [Richard Dale](): "it is Impossible to keep a number of Merchant ships togeather, in bad weather and long nights [during the winter]" (6 Nov 1801)
- BW1:619: [John Shaw]() given instructions from [Richard Dale]() about convoy procedure:
    - Notify consuls of the route he will take out of the Mediterranean
    - Remain only 2 or 3 days at each port unless 4 or 5 American captains request he wait
    - Be careful where you anchor because of bad winter weather
    - Write to upcoming consuls asking them to have any ships wishing convoy ready to go when he arrives
- Lt. [John Shaw]() had to write to the prime minister of the Two Sicilies to ask whether a ship that had been detained by that government would be available to sail with his convoy due to leave at the first fair wind, 7 January 1802 (BW2:14)
    - In the end, Shaw said that if the ship would not be released in time for the convoy, which was the last of the season, the ship and its cargo would have to be abandoned (and the USA would be on the hook for the damages) (BW2:22)  
- [John Shaw]() arrives at Leghorn to find that almost all the commercial ships had already sailed without waiting for him to convoy them, despite [Richard Dale]()'s warning that Tripolitan cruisers were out; the 3 that did stay for the convoy wouldn't keep up, so Shaw just let them go (BW2:57), 9 February 1802
    - Shaw later writes: "I should not be the least surprised if -- some capture -- was maid -- as our American Merchant Vessles is running in all directions -- with out the smallest protection. (In fact Generally speaking, the[y] pay but very little attention to Convoy I apprehend the[y] will repent -- when its to late" (BW2:76, 2 March 1802)
- BW2:215: [Daniel McNeill]() in the [USS *Boston*]() doesn't even make a real effort to corral the merchant ships for convoy: at Naples he makes clear his determination to sail in one day despite American merchants asking him to wait for 3 or 4; [Charles Wadsworth]() feels certain that at other Spanish ports the outcome will be the same. Wadsworth wishes they would stay 3 or 4 days in order to give him a chance to write to upcoming ports, but McNeill will have none of it (28 July 1802)

## Benefits/necessity of convoy
- BW2:50-51: [Richard Dale]() recommends that ships at Leghorn wait for [USS *Philadelphia*]() to arrive for convoy duty because he has received intelligence that 3 Tripolitan corsairs are abroad, 6 February 1802
- BW2:183-84: [Richard Valentine Morris]() recommends ships wait for convoy at Cadiz if planning to go through the Straits of Gibraltar, seeing as the relations with Morocco have deteriorated significantly, 25 June 1802
- BW2:218: [Alexander Murray]() thinks that convoy is necessary because the blockade isn't working (30 July 1802)

## Requests for convoy
- BW2:223: [Richard Valentine Morris]() writes to [Joseph Yznardy]() that 9 merchants in Cadiz have requested convoy westward (presumably through the Straits); he tells Yznardy that until [James Simpson]() has concluded his negotiations with Morocco, he can't instruct any ship to leave for convoy duty. If the negotiations are successful, Morris seems to be suggesting that no convoy will be necessary; if not, he will send the [USS *Adams*]() to collect vessels at Cadiz and Malaga, 3 August 1802
    - BW2:230: [Richard Valentine Morris]() responds to [Joseph Yznardy]()'s letter of 6 August acknowledging that the delay in leaving Cadiz may cause some problems for those merchants; however, the merchants at Malaga have just as much right to navy protection as Cadiz merchants have (11 August 1802)

## Records of convoy
- BW2:65: [William Bainbridge]() records taking 11 vessels through the Straits of Gibraltar, 23 February 1802
- BW2:78: [USS George Washington]() took vessels from Leghorn to Marseilles, February 1802
