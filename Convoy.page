One of the important but boring duties of the American squadron was to convoy American merchant vessels to and from ports in the Mediterranean. This of course took ships away from blockade duty.

"It was requisite That the Essex should convoy out of this sea. The american Vessels so long detained on acct of the Threatenings of Tripoli and The Snarlings of Algiers--& murmors of Tunis." --[Richard O'Brien]() to Secretary of State, September 26, 1801 (BW1:582)

## System
Regulations about convoy, BW2:39-40

Anywhere from 5-10 ships to hundreds could be part of a convoy. Typical American convoys were on the smaller side, as the Americans didn't have enough ships to support the larger ones.

- 1801: [USS Philadelphia]() convoys 10 American ships and 5 Swedish ships from Malaga to Alicant, Leghorn, and Naples (BW1:632)
- 1801: Circular warns ships against traveling in the Adriatic without convoy

## Irritations and delays
### Lack of ships to perform duty
- BW1:593: [Richard Dale]() to [William Kirkpatrick](): "it is my wish and Intention to give protection to all American Vessels, Either bound up the Mediterranean or down, as much, as in my Power lays, but the Commanders must have patience, I have to observe to you there is only three Ships of War in those seas at present belonging to the United States, one of them must be kept in or about this place, one off and about Tripoli so you see there is only one to go on the convoy Business."

### Difficulty of wrangling merchants
- BW1:615: [Richard Dale](): "it is Impossible to keep a number of Merchant ships togeather, in bad weather and long nights [during the winter]" (6 Nov 1801)
- BW1:619: [John Shaw]() given instructions from [Richard Dale]() about convoy procedure:
    - Notify consuls of the route he will take out of the Mediterranean
    - Remain only 2 or 3 days at each port unless 4 or 5 American captains request he wait
    - Be careful where you anchor because of bad winter weather
    - Write to upcoming consuls asking them to have any ships wishing convoy ready to go when he arrives
- Lt. [John Shaw]() had to write to the prime minister of the Two Sicilies to ask whether a ship that had been detained by that government would be available to sail with his convoy due to leave at the first fair wind, 7 January 1802 (BW2:14)
    - In the end, Shaw said that if the ship would not be released in time for the convoy, which was the last of the season, the ship and its cargo would have to be abandoned (and the USA would be on the hook for the damages) (BW2:22)  
- [John Shaw]() arrives at Leghorn to find that almost all the commercial ships had already sailed without waiting for him to convoy them, despite [Richard Dale]()'s warning that Tripolitan cruisers were out; the 3 that did stay for the convoy wouldn't keep up, so Shaw just let them go (BW2:57), 9 February 1802

## Benefits/necessity of convoy
- BW2:50-51: [Richard Dale]() recommends that ships at Leghorn wait for [USS *Philadelphia*]() to arrive for convoy duty because he has received intelligence that 3 Tripolitan corsairs are abroad, 6 February 1802
