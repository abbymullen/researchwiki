- [Algeciras](): [Richard Dale]() argues that the [USS President]() should not have to undergo quarantine as there has never been any infectious disease on board since she was built (this is definitely not true, since she had to leave the blockade of Tripoli because there were so many people on the sick list; possible he's referring only to the plague?) (BW1:596)--this is an open question: what constitutes sickness that would cause a ship to be quarantined?
