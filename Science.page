- BW1:342: Sec of State to William Eaton, 11 January 1800: "The Brig Sophia arrived with your dispatches the latter end of August, when the yellow fever had again obliged the public officers to remove from this city. New York was visited with the same disease at the same time; and the inhabitants of both cities generally removed into the country; whereby business was suspended. We returned hither the beginning of November."
