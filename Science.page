# American sailors' experience with disease in the Mediterranean
## Disease in captivity
- BW1:16-17: 17 April 1787: letter from [Richard O'Brien]() indicates that he thinks his crew are all going to die of the plague, especially if they continue to be assigned hard labor
    - Over the last three months, 200 Christian slaves died from the plague
    - One of O'Brien's crew had died already, and one had survived a bout of plague (with buboes)
