# American sailors' experience with disease in the Mediterranean
## Disease in captivity
- BW1:16-17: 17 April 1787: letter from [Richard O'Brien]() indicates that he thinks his crew are all going to die of the plague, especially if they continue to be assigned hard labor
    - Over the last three months, 200 Christian slaves died from the plague
    - One of O'Brien's crew had died already, and one had survived a bout of plague (with buboes)

## Disease in the United States
- BW1:342: Sec of State to William Eaton, 11 January 1800: "The Brig Sophia arrived with your dispatches the latter end of August, when the yellow fever had again obliged the public officers to remove from this city. New York was visited with the same disease at the same time; and the inhabitants of both cities generally removed into the country; whereby business was suspended. We returned hither the beginning of November."
- BW2:212: [Edward Preble]() cannot assume his duty because he is so sick that he can barely move, 12 April 1802

### Disease delays diplomacy
- BW1:344: [John Adams]() to [Hamouda Pasha](), 15 January 1800: "With respect to the time within which you required that the stipulated stores should be delivered, I have charged Mr Eaton to explain to you the impossibility of a compliance: and will here only observe that of the six months proposed, four had elapsed when your letter and the Consuls dispatches arrived: And then a pestilence raging in some of our principal cities by causing the inhabitants to flee into the country & suspending business, rendered delays unavoidable."

    - Around this same time, all the frigates had large sick lists: around 100 on *President*, 80 on *Essex*, and 70 on *Philadelphia* (BW1:634)
- BW2:11: [Alexander Murray]() notes that sailors who live "irregular lives while on shore" often end up on the doctor's list and stay there for a long time if their diet does not improve (1 January 1802)
