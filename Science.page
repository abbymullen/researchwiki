# American sailors' experience with disease in the Mediterranean

## Disease in the United States
- BW1:342: Sec of State to William Eaton, 11 January 1800: "The Brig Sophia arrived with your dispatches the latter end of August, when the yellow fever had again obliged the public officers to remove from this city.

We returned hither the beginning of November."

- BW1:344: [John Adams]() to [Hamouda Pasha](), 15 January 1800: "With respect to the time within which you required that the stipulated stores should be delivered, I have charged Mr Eaton to explain to you the impossibility of a compliance: and will here only observe that of the six months proposed, four had elapsed when your letter and the Consuls dispatches arrived: And then a pestilence raging in some of our principal cities by causing the inhabitants to flee into the country & suspending business, rendered delays unavoidable."
- BW2:369: [Richard Valentine Morris]() falls ill and is unable to return to the court of the bey of Tunis to continue making his case for the adjudication of the *Paulina*; sends [John Rodgers]() and [George Davis]() instead (7 March 1803)

    - Around this same time, all the frigates had large sick lists: around 100 on *President*, 80 on *Essex*, and 70 on *Philadelphia* (BW1:634)

- BW3:103-4: [William Bainbridge]() on the [USS *Philadelphia*](): "Having from 20 to 30 sick on board, this number with 13 left at Gibralter has reduced the force of our ship considerably, was a powerful reason for me to clear my ship as much as possible before I attempted the bad coast & ill climate of Tripoli" (4 October 1803)

# Medical supplies
- Each ship was issued a chest of medical tools and instruments, as well as a certain amount of medicine and spirits
- It is apparently difficult to keep the instruments in usable shape: they must be removed from the vessels when the ships aren't at sea: "When vessels arrive in any Port in the United States their medicine chests and instruments are in pursuance of the arrangement I have made, to be taken out and sent to this place where all the medicines that are good are taken out and carefully preserved & the instruments are kept in order, so as to be read for immediate use - By suffering the Chests to remain in the Vessels - We have heretofore lost all the medicines that remained on her arrival in port - the instruments have become rusty & in many instances entirely unfit for future use" (SecNav, 13 June 1803, BW2:451)
