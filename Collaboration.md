- [James Leander Cathcart]() to [James Madison](): "No. 4 will inform you the terms on which Sweden has concluded a Seperate peace with Tripoli, And on which Denmark and Holland have arranged their affairs with that Regency. We are now according to my prediction left to ourselves, And must trust to the strength of our own resources, which will render our negotiating with that Regency much more difficult than it Otherwise would have been, for it is natural to suppose that the Bashaw having forced the Northern Nations to such great concessions, will expect that the United States will follow their Example and comply with his demands. I declare I can see no reason why he should think otherwise, until we prove to him by demonstration that he is mistaken."
