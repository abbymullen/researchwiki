## Suggestions given
- BW2:274: [Andrew Morris]() writes to [Stephen Cathalan Jr.]() at Marseilles that the Tripolitan government is very eager to make peace, and if the American commodore would come talk with authorization from the president, they could likely make peace on American terms (15 September 1802) {this letter forwarded to SecState}

## Through other nations

Negotiations with Tripoli sometimes occurred through the other Barbary governments. As Algiers was the strongest of the four, it was also the most willing to step in as third party (for a price).

### Algiers
-   462: Letter to [James Leander Cathcart](), 10 May 1802: Tripoli tried to negotiate a treaty with the USA through Algiers (ASP2FR2: *Barbary powers. Communicated to Congress on the 15th December, 1802.*)
-   463: [Richard O'Brien]() to Sec of State, 1 Feb 1802
    -   Algerine government wants O'B to settle with Tripoline ambassador but requires some money to facilitate the negotiations?
    -   O'B declines to give them money outright, citing bad faith by Tripolitans in previous dealings
-   Richard O'Brien to Sec of State, 26 June 1802
    - Demanded that Algiers force the release of the Franklin as Algiers was supposedly the guarantor of the treaty between Tripoli and the United States
    - Further complained that the corsair had fitted out at Algiers, which was not acceptable
-   464
    - Algerine marine minister and prime minister claim that the presence of American frigates off Tripoli negates Algiers' responsibility to guarantee the treaty
    - O'B is warned by marine minister to tread lightly around the dey, who was going to crack down on the Spanish, British, and French (to which O'B replied that he didn't care what the dey did with them, he was going to report that Algiers was no friend of America but of Tripoli)
    - The dey came to some agreement about the Franklin, which was disregarded, at which time the dey ordered the corsair and prize to leave Algiers immediately
- BW2:279: [William Eaton]() says that "the Algerine Jew, Azulai" has told him that Algiers ordered Tripoli to give up the prisoners from the *Franklin*, but Eaton says, "we cannot suppose the Dey's interference in the present case can be pleasing to your Exy [[Yusuf Karamanli]()]: We believe it would suit better both the independence of your Ex" character and the interests of the parties that all our negociations should be direct and without the intervention of any other power" (18 September 1802) 
- BW2:289: [Richard O'Brien]() writes that the dey of Algiers is interested in brokering a treaty between Tripoli and the United States, to the total sum of $120,000 (some of which would go to Algiers as broker, of course) (11 October 1802)
- BW2:298: [William Eaton]() entreats [Richard Valentine Morris]() not to use Algiers as a broker: "above all things that Algiers should not be resorted to as a mediator between the parties - Is it forgotten that the Bashaw made the interference of that Dey in our establishment of a peace his sole pretext for violating the treaty? Or can it be so soon overlooked that the Dey refused his interference when called upon to inforce his guarantee of that treaty? It is hardly to be supposed that the Gov. of the U States, once deceived, would again expose themselves to a second insult on the same ground" (16 October 1802)
- BW2:322: [James Leander Cathcart]() writes to [Richard O'Brien]() that any agreement he has made with Algiers re: the [Franklin]()'s prisoners is not only unnecessary but injurious to the cause of peace with Tripoli; he further writes: "I am informed that a Negotiation is either clandestinely carrying on between the United States of America, and the Regency of Tripoli through the mediation of Algiers, or in Contemplation; I say a clandestine Negotiation, because if an such exist it must not only be unauthorized by Government, but Likewise in direct Violation of the Presidents Instructions to me on that head, And I being the only person vested with full powers to Enter into and to conclude a Treaty with that Regency, no Negotiation whatever can be valid until it receives my sanction and Signature. I therefore shall be in duty bound to declare it null and void unless it should be in strict Conformity to my Instructions," which are not to make any treaty that requires payment (25 November 1802)
    - Cathcart further writes that Algiers cannot be a part of any treaty with Tripoli, because it was Algiers's involvement in the last treaty that gave the bashaw the freedom to break the treaty
    - " it seems to me Extremely equivocal and absurd, that the regency of Algiers, having lent a deaf ear to all the amicable references and remonstrances of the United States, Should now Espouse the cause of the Agressor, But it certainly would be more absurd for the United States to admit them" (BW2:323) 

### Tunis
- 462: [James Leander Cathcart]() to Sec of State, 4 July 1802
    - Says that Eaton says that Tripoli is trying to make peace via Tunis: "We prefer peace to war when we can obtain it on honorable terms, but not otherwise."
 
 
## Negotiations through [Nicholas Nissen]()
- BW2:195: Nissen writes to [James Leander Cathcart]() on behalf of Sidi Muhammad Daguize, 8 July 1802
    - Daguize wants peace
    - The advisers who wanted war are now in disgrace with the bashaw
    - Daguize suggests that now would be an advantageous time to negotiate for peace
- BW2:202-3: [Alexander Murray]() agrees to grant free passage to the negotiators from Tripoli? But he reminds Nissen that the USA will not buy peace, since it is against the principles of their government, but once the bashaw understands that, they ought to be able to resolve the negotiations with relative ease (13 July 1802)
- [Nicholas Nissen]() advises [William Eaton]() to force the bashaw to honor his agreement with [Richard Dale]() about prisoner exchange before starting any peace negotiations -- asks Eaton to pass this information along to the new commodore, as he himself will likely not be able to give him the information soon enough (BW2:213, 27 July 1802)

## Problems with negotiations
- BW2:204: [James Leander Cathcart]() sees the capture of the [*Franklin*]() as a huge setback in the prospect of negotiations: "we were upon the eve of concluding a treaty upon terms which would not only have been honorable to the United States as a Nation, but would have establish'd a precedent worthy the imitation of other nations, & have founded n basis on which to establish our peace with the rest of the Barbary States in future, to be thus lull'd into a false security which has in a great measure blasted our most sanguine hopes is distressing beyond parallel, to have our vessels captured while the squadrons of the U, S of America & of Sweden are lending their aid to protect our commerce implies something very unfavorable to our energy & undoubtedly will be construed much to our disadvantage by the heads of the Barbary States" (15 July 1802)

## [Richard Valentine Morris]()
- Authorized to negotiate on behalf of the United States
- [Henry Wadsworth]() records how the negotiations are going: "The treaty is already drawn up, excepting one or two Articles. The White Flag is hoisted on both sides and hostilities suspended: Their Cruizers while the truce lasts are permitted to go into port should they arrive off here: but none to go out: The advantages are all on the side of the Enemy. therefore let the truce be short. A speedy peace or a still more speedy War" (7 June 1803, BW2:445)
- [Nicholas Nissen]() reports that by 9 June, the negotiations are over and no peace is concluded (BW2:447)
