## Suggestions given
- BW2:274: [Andrew Morris]() writes to [Stephen Cathalan Jr.]() at Marseilles that the Tripolitan government is very eager to make peace, and if the American commodore would come talk with authorization from the president, they could likely make peace on American terms (15 September 1802) {this letter forwarded to SecState}

## Through other nations

Negotiations with Tripoli sometimes occurred through the other Barbary governments. As Algiers was the strongest of the four, it was also the most willing to step in as third party (for a price).

### Algiers
-   462: Letter to [James Leander Cathcart](), 10 May 1802: Tripoli tried to negotiate a treaty with the USA through Algiers (ASP2FR2: *Barbary powers. Communicated to Congress on the 15th December, 1802.*)
-   463: [Richard O'Brien]() to Sec of State, 1 Feb 1802
    -   Algerine government wants O'B to settle with Tripoline ambassador but requires some money to facilitate the negotiations?
    -   O'B declines to give them money outright, citing bad faith by Tripolitans in previous dealings
-   Richard O'Brien to Sec of State, 26 June 1802
    - Demanded that Algiers force the release of the Franklin as Algiers was supposedly the guarantor of the treaty between Tripoli and the United States
    - Further complained that the corsair had fitted out at Algiers, which was not acceptable
-   464
    - Algerine marine minister and prime minister claim that the presence of American frigates off Tripoli negates Algiers' responsibility to guarantee the treaty
    - O'B is warned by marine minister to tread lightly around the dey, who was going to crack down on the Spanish, British, and French (to which O'B replied that he didn't care what the dey did with them, he was going to report that Algiers was no friend of America but of Tripoli)
    - The dey came to some agreement about the Franklin, which was disregarded, at which time the dey ordered the corsair and prize to leave Algiers immediately

### Tunis
- 462: James Leander Cathcart to Sec of State, 4 July 1802
    - Says that Eaton says that Tripoli is trying to make peace via Tunis: "We prefer peace to war when we can obtain it on honorable terms, but not otherwise."
 
 
## Negotiations through [Nicholas Nissen]()
- BW2:195: Nissen writes to [James Leander Cathcart]() on behalf of Sidi Muhammad Daguize, 8 July 1802
    - Daguize wants peace
    - The advisers who wanted war are now in disgrace with the bashaw
    - Daguize suggests that now would be an advantageous time to negotiate for peace
- BW2:202-3: [Alexander Murray]() agrees to grant free passage to the negotiators from Tripoli? But he reminds Nissen that the USA will not buy peace, since it is against the principles of their government, but once the bashaw understands that, they ought to be able to resolve the negotiations with relative ease (13 July 1802)
- [Nicholas Nissen]() advises [William Eaton]() to force the bashaw to honor his agreement with [Richard Dale]() about prisoner exchange before starting any peace negotiations -- asks Eaton to pass this information along to the new commodore, as he himself will likely not be able to give him the information soon enough (BW2:213, 27 July 1802)

## Problems with negotiations
- BW2:204: [James Leander Cathcart]() sees the capture of the [*Franklin*]() as a huge setback in the prospect of negotiations: "we were upon the eve of concluding a treaty upon terms which would not only have been honorable to the United States as a Nation, but would have establish'd a precedent worthy the imitation of other nations, & have founded n basis on which to establish our peace with the rest of the Barbary States in future, to be thus lull'd into a false security which has in a great measure blasted our most sanguine hopes is distressing beyond parallel, to have our vessels captured while the squadrons of the U, S of America & of Sweden are lending their aid to protect our commerce implies something very unfavorable to our energy & undoubtedly will be construed much to our disadvantage by the heads of the Barbary States" (15 July 1802)
