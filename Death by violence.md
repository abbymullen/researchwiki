    - [Daniel Carmick]() records the circumstances of the duel and its aftermath: "I was witness to a scene I shall ever remember, that of being obliged to see a Brother Officers heart cut out, that I might certify that the Ball had passed through the center of it, but the laws (they told me) were not yet fully executed, that the Ball must be found to be produced to the Court, I remonstrated with them for some time, and even threatened to make a corpse of the Surgeon should I prove that he was cutting up my friend for the experience of his Students, to recollect that he had died a brave and honourable man, and not a Culprit; they all affirmed in one voice that it was the law of the land, I left them up to their Armpitts in blood." (BW2:294)
    - Carmick also records that [Alexander Murray]() wanted it inscribed on McKnight's tombstone that "he had fallen a victim to a false idea of Honor" (BW2:295)
