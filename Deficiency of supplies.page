Supplies were difficult to come by, and the supplies brought on board at the beginning of the cruise were not always high quality, so even those brought from the United States sometimes had to be replaced when ships were still in the Mediterranean. Sometimes ships sailed without adequate provision of naval stores such as cord (see [Samuel Barron](), BW1:632).
