Supplies were difficult to come by, and the supplies brought on board at the beginning of the cruise were not always high quality, so even those brought from the United States sometimes had to be replaced when ships were still in the Mediterranean. Sometimes ships sailed without adequate provision of naval stores such as cord (see [Samuel Barron](), BW1:632).

- BW2:11-12: [Alexander Murray]() complains to the Secretary of the Navy about the rations based on his observations during his previous cruise
    - Beef: Poor quality and insufficient quantity (British navy does better)
    - Pork: "sufficient"
    - Fish: excluded per regulations
    - Potatoes and onions and other vegetables: ought to be allowed to be purchased locally
    - Desired: "Kiln dry'd Indian Meal" with Molasses (for breakfast)
    - "A soldier may have his resources, but the sailor hath no subterfuge when pinched"?
- BW2:17: [Alexander Murray]() is really concerned about supplies: he states that provisions run out quickly once ships reach the Med, and therefore he's not taking a full ration of everything since he's going to have to refill supplies in the Med anyway.
- BW2:73: "You must be frugal, in all your demands," writes [Richard Dale]() to [John Shaw]() in regards to taking stores from the store ship at Gibraltar, 2 March 1802
- BW2:136: "I am told [bread] ought to be baked over a second time. - Great complaints have been made in the Navy respecting bread. I pray you let there be no cause of Complaint, in that which you ship" (SecNav to [John Stricker](), naval agent, 27 April 1802)
- BW2:242: [Alexander Murray]() writes to [Richard Valentine Morris]() that he has taken only a temporary supply of provisions at Malta, as they are expensive and hard to get, and will get more supplies later at Leghorn, 20 August 1802
- BW2:315: [Alexander Murray](), having sprung his main and topmast on the route from Toulon to Gibraltar, ran out of supplies and had to stop in at Malaga in order to get repairs and acquire supplies, writing to [William Kirkpatrick](): "We have not one ounce of bread on board & beg you will send me off about 1000 lb. for present use" (19 November 1802)
- BW3:59: [Edward Preble]() writes, "It is absolutely necessary that every Article which composes our ration's should be sent out from the United States as they cannot, in consequence of the War between England and France be purchased at Gibralter and even if they could the prices at present are 50 pr Cent higher than in time of peace; Candles and Molasses have heretofore been much wanted by the other squadron, they are articles that cannot be procured, on any terms in this Country" (18 September 1803)
