- BW2:291: [James Leander Cathcart]() refuses to negotiate with [Yusuf Karamanli]() without official word from the government; he also doesn't want to pay out: "I am likewise confirmed in my opinion that could a peace be obtained for five thousand dollars it would be as contrary to our interests, as repugnant to our feelings, to pay it for any other purpose, than merely as a Consular present, on the establishment of a Consul, and not even then if it could possibly be avoided" (12 October 1802)
