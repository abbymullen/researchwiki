The Barbary States were technically regencies of the Ottoman Empire, though they seem to have been fairly independent of Turkish control. Only on occasion did the Turkish government intervene in Barbary affairs.

- [Richard O'Brien]() reports that the Turkish government gifted Algiers with recruits and naval stores. He suggests two possible motives for this move:
    1. "to strengthen the hands of this State, the principal political Redoubt of the Ottoman Empire" or
    2. "to lull this Regency into security to plunder them" (BW1:617)
