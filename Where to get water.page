- BW1:522: [Richard Dale]() intends to get water at either [Malta]() or [Syracuse](), 19 July 1801, but he tells [Samuel Barron]() to get as much water and food as he can at [Port Farina]()
    - Dale estimates he can stay out for about 5 weeks before needing more water
- BW1:530: [Samuel Barron]() had to receive a coasting pilot at Gibraltar to get water from [Tetuan]() because the governor of [Gibraltar]() would not allow warships to water there, 24 July 1801
    - Contra [Rufus King](), who wrote that the British were opening the stores of Gibraltar, [Malta]() and [Minorca]() to American ships of war, 24 July 1801 (BW1:531)

- BW1:553: Dale sent [USS *Enterprise*] to Malta with the idea of its bringing back enough water for [USS *President*] to stay on the blockade, but *Enterprise* was unable to bring back enough water to prevent *President* from needing to leave its station (18 August 1801)
