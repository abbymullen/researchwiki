- SecNav to [Richard Valentine Morris](): "The Lazarettos in the Mediterranean, are, I believe, very justly considered as the graves of all foreigners who are so unfortunate as to be obliged to enter them. - I deem it therefore necessary to lodge with you a discretionary power to establish a temporary hospital in some one of the most healthy ports of the Mediterranean, if you can obtain permission so to do, and it should appear to you an adviseable measure." (BW2:106, 5 April 1802)
    - Suggests Syracuse as possible location
    - One surgeon and one mate to be appointed to the hospital
- SecNav orders [John Bullus]() to prepare supplies for 1000 men for a year for the hospital being created (BW2:123)
- 13 July 1803: SecNav writes to [Edward Preble]() about the hospital: "The establishment of an Hospital for the reception of the sick and disabled seamen of the squadron, has heretofore been authorized, but **no such establishment has been made.** Care must be taken of our seamen & great advantages will result from their being made sensible that **we regard them as an useful class of citizens and in all respects deserving of our care and attenfion**. I deem it, therefore, proper to invest you with a discretionary power to establish an hospital in Malta if permitted, or in some other of the most healthy ports in the vicinity of Tripoli, and you may commit the superintendency of it to one of the surgeons of the Fleet and if necessary allow him a Mate. A chest of Medicines & Instruments was sent to Gibraltar to be used in such an Establishment. You will, I presume, find it there and you will use it if necessary." (BW2:476)
- BW3:34: [Edward Preble]() writes orders for his ships related to the health of the crew:
    - "The main deck is to be constantly kept as clear as possible and no chests, empty casks, or lumber of any kind suffered to remain on it - a great object, being the health of the men. Dry air should be admitted especially in Summer or warm climates, but rain and the wash of the Sea should be avoided, and air that is damp admitted with great caution, a thorough draft of air in the channel is not necessary for any length of time, and should be introduced in preference at such time as the men are employed on deck"
- BW3:49: [Edward Preble]() assigns the *Mirboka* as a hospital ship for the sick of the [USS *Philadelphia*]() (16 September 1803) 
- BW3:161: [Edward Preble]() requests an armed supply ship to be sent to Syracuse where he can use it as a store and hospital ship, because "it would be preferable to landing our provisions or men, as the men will often desert, when they recover" (23 October 1803)
