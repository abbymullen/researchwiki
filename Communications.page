## Communications with Washington

## Communications with diplomats
- 27 July 1802: [Nicholas Nissen]() observes that it is "very seldom that I have any opportunity to correspond with the Commanders of the Situation of the affairs here," perhaps partly because the commanders don't see a need to, but also because the commanders aren't near Tripoli to be communicated with (BW2:213)

## Communications amongst the squadron
- Communications were terribly slow even though the space the squadron occupied was not that large
    - BW2:22: [William Bainbridge]() records having just received a letter on 15 January 1802 from [Richard Dale]() written on 15 December 1801
- Communications amongst the squadron are so bad for the second cruise that [Alexander Murray]() gets all the way to Malaga without knowing that [Thomas Truxtun]() is not the commodore anymore (BW2:140, 30 April 1802)
- Similarly, Murray does not know that [Richard Valentine Morris]() has arrived in the Mediterranean, so he gives orders to [Andrew Sterett]() and others from Tunis while Morris is sitting in Gibraltar (see BW2:164), 2 June 1802.

## Communications with Barbary rulers
- Important to remember that communications often went through at least one, maybe two translators between Barbary ruler and American commodore or diplomat
    - E.g., letter from Moroccan secretary of state to [James Simpson]() and [Peter Wyk]() is translated from Arabic into Spanish into English, 10 May 1802 (BW2:150)
- Communications slowness meant difficulty in maintaining negotiations: [James Simpson]() pleads with the emperor of Morocco to have patience: "Although the great distance of America from this country, necessarily occasions considerable delay to answers on any subject submitted from hence, and of consequence that this determination of the President has been long in reachmg your majesty, yet I fully persuade myself your majesty will see in his ready attention to send to your majesty what appeared would be acceptable, a strong proof of the sincere intention of the government of the United States, faithfully to maintain not only peace, but the strictest friendship and good harmony with your majesty." (BW2:220, 31 July 1802)
