## Communications with Washington

## Communications with diplomats

## Communications amongst the squadron
- Communications were terribly slow even though the space the squadron occupied was not that large
    - BW2:22: [William Bainbridge]() records having just received a letter on 15 January 1802 from [Richard Dale]() written on 15 December 1801
- Communications amongst the squadron are so bad for the second cruise that [Alexander Murray]() gets all the way to Malaga without knowing that [Thomas Truxtun]() is not the commodore anymore (BW2:140, 30 April 1802)
- Similarly, Murray does not know that [Richard Valentine Morris]() has arrived in the Mediterranean, so he gives orders to [Andrew Sterett]() and others from Tunis while Morris is sitting in Gibraltar (see BW2:164), 2 June 1802.

## Communications with Barbary rulers
- Important to remember that communications often went through at least one, maybe two translators between Barbary ruler and American commodore or diplomat
    - E.g., letter from Moroccan secretary of state to [James Simpson]() and [Peter Wyk]() is translated from Arabic into Spanish into English, 10 May 1802 (BW2:150)
