## Communications with Washington

## Communications with diplomats
- 27 July 1802: [Nicholas Nissen]() observes that it is "very seldom that I have any opportunity to correspond with the Commanders of the Situation of the affairs here," perhaps partly because the commanders don't see a need to, but also because the commanders aren't near Tripoli to be communicated with (BW2:213)
- 15 September 1802: [William Willis]() writes that he wishes Commodore [Richard Valentine Morris]() would have called at Barcelona because he would have been able to pass on info about a Tripolitan cruiser that had been sighted only a few days previous (BW2:275)
- 22 October 1802: [William Eaton]() writes, "it embarrasses me to account for our squadron having lain ten days in Cagliari, only eighteen hours sail from this, without enquiring whether peace still subsisted here, or without giving me a word of information; more peculiarly so as there are frequent occasions from that port to this [Tunis]. Whatever may be the motive of these omissions, they are injurious in effect to the public interest" (BW2:305)
- 25 November 1802: [James Leander Cathcart]() writes to [Richard O'Brien]() that [Richard Dale]() had previously made arrangements for a prisoner exchange, so any arrangement or obligation O'Brien had entered with the dey were not only unnecessary, they were injurious to the cause of peace (BW2:322)--lack of communications between diplomats
- 20 December 1802: [Alexander Murray]() uses [Hugh G. Campbell]() and the [USS *Adams*]() as an errand boy from Gibraltar to Tangier, telling Campbell to run over to Tangier and tell [James Simpson]() that Murray will call on him on his way out: so that "he may be prepared to furnish himself with the best knowledge of the Emperor of Morocco's disposition towards us, so as not to delay me, the Weather being very precarious at this season of the Year" (BW2:336)

## Communications amongst the squadron
- Communications were terribly slow even though the space the squadron occupied was not that large
    - BW2:22: [William Bainbridge]() records having just received a letter on 15 January 1802 from [Richard Dale]() written on 15 December 1801
- Communications amongst the squadron are so bad for the second cruise that [Alexander Murray]() gets all the way to Malaga without knowing that [Thomas Truxtun]() is not the commodore anymore (BW2:140, 30 April 1802)
- Similarly, Murray does not know that [Richard Valentine Morris]() has arrived in the Mediterranean, so he gives orders to [Andrew Sterett]() and others from Tunis while Morris is sitting in Gibraltar (see BW2:164), 2 June 1802.
- BW2:246: Despite finally hearing from Morris, Murray is not given any actual instructions from him, so he is left going his own way again, 22 August 1802
- BW2:287: [Hugh G. Campbell](), knowing that he will not hear from Commodore [Richard Valentine Morris]() for several weeks, makes the decision to allow [James Simpson]() to issue a passport for the [*Meshouda*]() (1 October 1802)
    - He writes: "So tedious is Communication about these Seas, that I have now two Letters for him from Captn Murry, dated Malta 20th Augt shall be under the Necessity of returning them to Malta by the first Ship of War that goes."
- BW2:310: [Alexander Murray]() thinks communications are so poor between him and [Richard Valentine Morris]() (Murray around Malaga and Morris off Tripoli), that he writes to the Secretary of the Navy instead of to Morris, 7 November 1802

## Communications with Barbary rulers
- Important to remember that communications often went through at least one, maybe two translators between Barbary ruler and American commodore or diplomat
    - E.g., letter from Moroccan secretary of state to [James Simpson]() and [Peter Wyk]() is translated from Arabic into Spanish into English, 10 May 1802 (BW2:150)
- Communications slowness meant difficulty in maintaining negotiations: [James Simpson]() pleads with the emperor of Morocco to have patience: "Although the great distance of America from this country, necessarily occasions considerable delay to answers on any subject submitted from hence, and of consequence that this determination of the President has been long in reachmg your majesty, yet I fully persuade myself your majesty will see in his ready attention to send to your majesty what appeared would be acceptable, a strong proof of the sincere intention of the government of the United States, faithfully to maintain not only peace, but the strictest friendship and good harmony with your majesty." (BW2:220, 31 July 1802)
