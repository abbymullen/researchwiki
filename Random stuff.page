Personnel: Recording how officers in the navy get discharged
- Lieutenant Palmer (possibly on board the USS Adams?): "I have not a doubt of Lieuti Palmer's having acted very reprehensibly, and feel no disposition to overlook such pointed inattontion to positive instructions, he will therefore be dismissed." (BW1:630, 8 December 1801)
