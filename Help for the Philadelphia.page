- BW3:308-9: [Robert Livingston]() writes to [Talleyrand]() requesting help: 
    - "In soliciting
his mediation for the establishment of Peace between the United
States and Tripoly, and releasing from Slavery the unhappy Men I
have mentioned. I afford him a new means of extending to a distant
World that species of Glory, which is I am satisfied dearest to his heart." (2 January 1804)
    - Also appeals to his sense of commercial interest: "Nor sir, will he want a direct cause for this interference founded on
the interest of France and Italy, which are deeply engaged in the uninterupted
Commerce of the United States during a War in which
their view is arrested."
