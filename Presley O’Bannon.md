Campbell]() writes of him: "OBannon one of the Happiest fellows Living, he has just returned from spending the Evening with a Brilliant Circle of spanish Ladys, & By way of Consolation for the loss of their company, Philosiphy & the fiddle is called to his aid, on the latter he is now playing, Hogs in the Cornfield" (BW2:335)
