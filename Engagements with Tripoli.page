The Commodore made a signal for the John Adam, to make sail - she had every thing then set that could be of any advantage, but one lower steering sail, which was instantly set. The wind still decreasing & not comeing up with the New York, the Commodore, hove too, with his Main Top sail aback, & made the signal for the John Adams, to lead the Van; she accordingly passed the New Ywk & commenced the action on the Gun boats, Zebec & Forts. The Commodore took a position, about 3 or 4 Cables length, on the weather bow of the John Adams, & fired 2 or 3 broad sides, after which no report was heard from his battery. The John Adams continued firing untill darkness prevented objects from being distinguished. The Forts & Gun boats kept a constant fire. The John Adams remained, on the scene of action all night. In the morning the Commodore, with the remainder of his Squadron were about 11 or 12 miles distance to the Northward & Westward" 
- [Thomas Hooper](), marine, who wrote this report to [William Eaton](), clearly disapproved of the conduct of [Richard Valentine Morris]() during this skirmish (BW2:415)
- [Henry Wadsworth]() comments on the role of darkness in the skirmish: "it was now just dusk & we could no longer discern our enemies but by the flash of their guns: had their been anyone on board who like Joshua of Old could have commanded the sun to stand still, Thy Gun Boats would have been ours Tripoly, & thy people our Slaves" (BW2:425)

- [USS *Adams*](): "Capt. Hull he said that they had 10 sail of small craft in a small bay, that the Adams lay watching them & kept firing now & then to keep them from unlading. Cargoes wheat: none of them were more than 25 tons nor less than 12 or 15. At 5 P. M we anchor'd in company with the Adams - one short mile from the Shore. The Boats were all aground. Four of their Skippers had come off to the Adams, saying they were Tuniseans: the Comr sent them this Notice to haul their boats off along side of us, before 12 oclock or we would burn them. Our Boats were order'd to Row Guard & at 8 oclock, but I am too fast - let me return - all the afternoon there were about 1000 people about on different emininces. Some on Arabian horses - riding full speed flourishing their guns over their heads & cutting Capers The Adams now & then giving them a shot for Amusement. On the banks just where the Boats were grounded was a stone house, built something like a fortification. At 8 oclock the ships Jolly Boat with 5 men each armed with a Cutlass Musket and a pair of pistols, with the first Lieutnt Mr Porter & Mr. Wadsworth Midn put off from the ship, we call'd along side of the Enterprize & took one of her Boats armed with us. in the two Boats there were 10 Men. We row'd softly within about pistol shot of the enemies Boat when we heard them talking - presently they sett up a yelling and fir'd upon us from another quarter We return'd the fire Briskly their shot went over us - & struck around. The Moon was over the land & shone Brightly upon us, affording an excellent mark for them We could not see them, or if by chance, or hard looking, we caught a glimpse, t'was momentary."
- Various boats from various vessels mounted an assault with combustibles; they went in toward the shore and tried to set fire to the boats who had run aground; alas, their attempt was not particularly successful (BW2:436)

### 22 June 1803

## Captures (see [Captivity]())
- 17 June 1802: [Andrew Morris]() and the brig [Franklin]() captured by 3 Tripolitan cruisers off Cape Pallas
    - Was initially brought into Algiers but [Richard O'Brien]()'s objections caused the Tripolitans to "make a hasty retreat" to Bizerta in Tunis, and after 5 days to Tripoli
    - [Nicholas Nissen]() intervened to give Morris relative liberty; [Bryan McDonogh]() claimed 3 crew members as British subjects, and 2 more were let go as foreign passengers; therefore only Morris and three other crew members remain in captivity
    - Morris questions how it was possible that the USA did not intervene; he even states that as he was being brought in to Tripoli, there were an American and a Swedish frigate who could have recaptured the *Franklin*
    - " I do not wish to attack blame to any man, but this transaction was in open day in Sight of thousands amongst which the Consuls of different nations can testify - I have not the honor of being known by you, but be assured that it is not from a ill heart, nor the thoughts of my Situation deprived of the converse of a wife, family and friends, and what is dear to every American, Liberty, that induces me to State the foregoing facts, It is the exultation of these Barbarians at Such conduct that gives me pain" (BW2:176-77)
