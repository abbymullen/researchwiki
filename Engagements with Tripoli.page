- 1 August 1801
- *Tripoli* nearly destroyed, 20 men killed and 30 wounded (of 80-man crew)
- *Enterprise* largely unharmed, no casualties

## Skirmishes
### 16 May 1802
- [USS *Boston*]() drove a vessel on shore near Tripoli; in conjunction with the Swedish fleet, fired on gun boats sent out to assist the stranded vessel; the Swedes were also cannonading the fort of Tripoli but the *Boston* was not involved in that (BW2:154)

### 22 July 1802
- [USS *Constellation*]() and the [*Thetis*]() encounter 9 gunboats, which they fired at for about half an hour (11:00-11:30), with no damage to the Americans or Swedish, but [Alexander Murray]() reports that the squadron inflicted damage on both ships and men (BW2:209) 
    - In a different report, Murray says there were 8 gunboats plus the admiral's galley; plus 6000 men gathered on shore, which the two frigates routed with cannon fire (BW2:218)
 

## Reports of cruisers
- 17 May 1802: [Alexander Murray]() notes that there were no Tripolitan cruisers out as of 31 April (BW2:155)
- 1 June 1802: 1 small Tripoline galley out, plus "two Pirates on the Coast of Spain, which hath created great alarm on that Coast"---uncertain whether the two pirates are Tripolitan or not ([Alexander Murray](), BW2:163)
- 4 June 1802: Two Tripolitan galliots at sea ([William Eaton](), BW2:159)
- [James Leander Cathcart]() reports 5 Tripolitan cruisers out, 7 July 1802 (BW2:194)

## Captures (see [Captivity]())
- 17 June 1802: [Andrew Morris]() and the brig [Franklin]() captured by 3 Tripolitan cruisers off Cape Pallas
    - Was initially brought into Algiers but [Richard O'Brien]()'s objections caused the Tripolitans to "make a hasty retreat" to Bizerta in Tunis, and after 5 days to Tripoli
    - [Nicholas Nissen]() intervened to give Morris relative liberty; [Bryan McDonogh]() claimed 3 crew members as British subjects, and 2 more were let go as foreign passengers; therefore only Morris and three other crew members remain in captivity
    - Morris questions how it was possible that the USA did not intervene; he even states that as he was being brought in to Tripoli, there were an American and a Swedish frigate who could have recaptured the *Franklin*
    - " I do not wish to attack blame to any man, but this transaction was in open day in Sight of thousands amongst which the Consuls of different nations can testify - I have not the honor of being known by you, but be assured that it is not from a ill heart, nor the thoughts of my Situation deprived of the converse of a wife, family and friends, and what is dear to every American, Liberty, that induces me to State the foregoing facts, It is the exultation of these Barbarians at Such conduct that gives me pain" (BW2:176-77)
