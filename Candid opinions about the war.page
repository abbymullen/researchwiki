Sometimes people gave their frank opinions about the progress and nature of the war. 

## Boring
- 3 February 1802: "We are leading a lazy life & I assure you Sir atiresome one, no Enemy to afford a Laurel! or present a song! but a Gratification exists, that of having reserved our Countrymen from  the most wretched of all species of Slavery." ([John R. Fenwick](), BW2:47) 
- 

## Wretched
- 26 April 1802: [William Eaton]() to [James Leander Cathcart](), about Tunis: "Think no more my Friend of this horrid Country I would rather see my wife and family in the deserts of Siberia" (BW2:135)
- 

## Differences of opinion about the strategy
- Lt. [John Shaw](), 29 April 1802: " a letter from Capt Barron to Mr Gavino mentioned of Tripoli being in great want of Provitie and he was led to believe that a close Blockcade would undoubtedly bring them to our terms But I am of an Opinion that a few Shot and Shell would be the Most effectual Medcine to Administer to their
Careless renegadoes" (BW2:138)
- [William Eaton](), contra [Alexander Murray](), 8 June 1802: "I labored to enforce my ideas of pushing the war on Cap. Murray's consent. He says the system is neither in tho view nor the abilities of the U States: but that we must rely on the magnanimity of Europe to regulate these states altogether - Men and nations must undergo more than a Christian regeneration before we shall see Europe volunteering in the protection of the commerce of the U States" (BW2:169)
