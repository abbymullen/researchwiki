Sometimes people gave their frank opinions about the progress and nature of the war. 

## Boring
- 3 February 1802: "We are leading a lazy life & I assure you Sir atiresome one, no Enemy to afford a Laurel! or present a song! but a Gratification exists, that of having reserved our Countrymen from  the most wretched of all species of Slavery." ([John R. Fenwick](), BW2:47) 
- 

## Wretched
- 26 April 1802: [William Eaton]() to [James Leander Cathcart](), about Tunis: "Think no more my Friend of this horrid Country I would rather see my wife and family in the deserts of Siberia" (BW2:135)
- 23 August 1802: [William Eaton]() again: "Our operations of the last and present year produce nothing in effect but additional enemies and national contempt. If the same system of operations continue, so will the same consequences. The obstinate posture and affected indifference to menace, which have hitherto been my talismen in lieu of solid argument here, no longer avail. The Minister puffs a whistle in my face, and says; "We find it is all a puff! We see how you carry on the war with Tripoli!" I have never ceased to give the alarm in due season: to suggest such measures as seemed to me indispensible to parry serious mischief; and to point out what I believed would be the consequence of neglecting that advice. I have now the melancholy reflection that my apprehensions have been but too well founded, and my predictions but too accurate. My exile is become insupportable here. Abandoned by my countrymen in command ; no advice from government to regulate my conduct; and in own exertions failing of effect; I am left subject, though not yet submissive, to the most intolerable abuse and personal vexation. Anxiety, perplexity and a climate unfavorable to my constitution, waste my health." He goes on to cite Alexander Murray's attacks on him as significant blows to his body and character, and also excoriates the commanders for not being aggressive enough, and then asks to resign unless the navy is planning a more aggressive approach, in which case he wants to stay (BW2:248-49) 
- BW2:271: Lt. [Presley O'Bannon]() writes to [William W. Burrows]() that he can't wait to get out of Gibraltar, "this wretched Hole, where we have not experienced one pleasant scence since our being stationd here, except what has been produced within ourselves," 10 September 1802

## Differences of opinion about the strategy
- Lt. [John Shaw](), 29 April 1802: " a letter from Capt Barron to Mr Gavino mentioned of Tripoli being in great want of Provitie and he was led to believe that a close Blockcade would undoubtedly bring them to our terms But I am of an Opinion that a few Shot and Shell would be the Most effectual Medcine to Administer to their
Careless renegadoes" (BW2:138)
- [William Eaton](), contra [Alexander Murray](), 8 June 1802: "I labored to enforce my ideas of pushing the war on Cap. Murray's consent. He says the system is neither in tho view nor the abilities of the U States: but that we must rely on the magnanimity of Europe to regulate these states altogether - Men and nations must undergo more than a Christian regeneration before we shall see Europe volunteering in the protection of the commerce of the U States" (BW2:169)
- Purser [Charles Wadsworth]() of the [USS *Boston*]() does not agree with the approach Alexander Murray has adopted: He writes to [William Eaton](), "I have very little doubt could you you see him [[Richard Valentine Morris]()] in person you would be able to mange the business respecting the Adimant Bashaw to your wishes - notwithstanding what the old Woman Captn Murray has done" (28 July 1802, BW2:216) 


## Lack of energy
- BW2:311: [William Eaton](): "I am apprehensive Government will be as much disappointd at the ineffectual operations of this season as any individual can have been. It is most unfortunate that any events should have impeded the squadron proceeding to its intended station. The moment was favorable - it is past - and we must retrieve by accelerated energy what we have lost by moderation" (9 November 1802)
