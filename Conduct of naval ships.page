On paper the regulations concerning how ships and their crews ought to behave were quite clear. In practice they were quite a bit more fluid.

## Rules (perhaps unspoken but clear)
- Don't lie about where you've been. (cf. [Daniel McNeill](), BW2:44)
- Don't take non-crew members away, especially against their will 
    - [Daniel McNeill](), BW2:45: [Richard Dale]() writes him, "Permit me to impress on your mind the necessity there is in keeping up a good understanding mth the Commanders of the Ships that you have to act in conjunction with you will always keep in view (I hope) the Honor of your Country and your Brother Officers"

- Don't use a public ship for private purposes.
    - BW2:42: [Secretary of the Navy]() roundly condemns a packet sent to the Mediterranean with supplies for the squadron, who instead took on private cargo as well, delaying the delivery of supplies to the squadron and forcing them to buy from the British, 28 January 1802---"the whole cargo was brought into jeopardy and the integrity of the commander of the squadron, & indeed of the government of the U. S. itself might have been called in question." 


## Guidelines

These guidelines aren't quite "rules," but they're strong recommendations about how naval ships should conduct themselves in front of the Barbary States.

- Hoist the American flag to indicate that they want to speak to the consul
- Do not anchor until the consul is on his way 
- After you anchor, salute the fortifications with the same number of guns as it saluted you with
- Always be ready to sail or clear for action
- Ask the consul if there are any contagious diseases in Algiers
- The consul comes aboard and lets the captain know when he can see the dey or ministers
- The rowers of the consular boat should not speak to any Americans, and the American sailors should not speak to any Algerines, in order to avoid misrepresentations and confusion
- If any runaway slaves should get on board the ship, they must be returned and the consul informed
- Every salute, which is given each time the consul or the captain goes ashore, costs the USA 76 dollars (same as for Swedish, Danish, or Dutch; British and French cost 60 dollrs); every time the consul comes in an Algerine boat he pays 8 dollars

## Violations
- [Daniel McNeill]()'s business with the quarantine
- [William Eaton]() writes in a panic about "unmilitary conduct of some one of the Gentlemen Commanding under you in the Squadron of the United States in this Sea"
    - It seems that an American (of uncertain identity) captured and spoiled a Tunisian xebec
    - "It cannot be supposed an object with our Government to carry on a predatory war here, even against our enemies, much less against our friends; or, if that were an object, that it should be degraded so far below any thing which has hitherto marked our national character as to descend to individual plunder and stripping."
    - Eaton acknowledges that he has heard only one side of the story, but he believes that side
    - " The affair has occasioned me serious perplexity here; it went very nearly to have produced a rupture with this Regency - I have followed the maxims of justice and honor in my arrangements to accommodate it: but the ammount of the payments should be reclaimed of those who committed the Violence."
    - All he knows is that it was an American schooner, and there's only one American schooner on station, so it has to be the [USS *Enterprise]()
    - Learns later that it was 3 privates who plundered the xebec, not any officers
    - Eaton is also relieved to learn that the Tunisians have much more to complain about how the Swedes have captured their vessels, which takes the pressure off the Americans (BW2:158, 21 May 1802)
    - The plundering that took place turns out to have been a watch and some money from a Turk; [Charles Wadsworth]() hopes that if the three "lads" get the death penalty, they will be executed in Tunis Bay so that the bey of Tunis can see that the American officers did not approve or or authorize the plundering (BW2:161, 29 May 1802)
- BW2:210: [William Bainbridge]() hears of a mutiny on board the [USS *Essex*](), seemingly because they do not want to return to the USA? He gave his crew the choice between doing as they were ordered to do, or being put in irons. 18 men chose irons. 25 July 1802

## Difficulties between officers and their subordinates
- BW2:299: Lt. [Jacob Jones]() writes to [Alexander Murray]() to mend the relationship after they apparently had words and Murray put Jones under arrest (for insubordination, apparently) (unknown date)

## Etiquette between navy and other nations' courts
- [James Leander Cathcart]() pleads with commodore [Richard Valentine Morris]() to make an appearance in the bashaw (bey)'s court, as that is proper protocol: "his presence would be of infinite service to our affairs here....The sequel serves to prove how often those Bashaws wear unmeaning frowns, and the necessity of observing a decisive line of conduct in the most trifling transactions. I did not wait upon the Bashaw, in Compliment to the Commodore, Neither did I receive the visits of the Consuls of other Nations, for the same reason" (BW2:351, 24 February 1803)
