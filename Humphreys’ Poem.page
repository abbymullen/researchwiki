How long, Columbians dear! will ye complain  return
OF wrongs unpunish'd on the midland main?  return
In timid sloth shall injur'd brav'ry sleep?  return
Awake! awake! avengers of the deep!  return
Revenge! revenge! the voice of nature cries;
Awake to glory, and to vengeance rise!
To arms! to arms! ye bold, indignant bands!
'Tis Heav'n inspires, 'tis God himself commands:
Save human nature from such deadly harms,
By force of reason, or by force of arms.
