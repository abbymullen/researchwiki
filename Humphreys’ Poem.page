How long, Columbians dear! will ye complain
OF wrongs unpunish'd on the midland main?
In timid sloth shall injur'd brav'ry sleep?
Awake! awake! avengers of the deep!
Revenge! revenge! the voice of nature cries;
Awake to glory, and to vengeance rise!
To arms! to arms! ye bold, indignant bands!
'Tis Heav'n inspires, 'tis God himself commands:
Save human nature from such deadly harms,
By force of reason, or by force of arms.
