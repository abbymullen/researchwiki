- 1789: Consul at Algiers
- BW1:67: Logie accused of manufacturing Portuguese truce with Algiers in order to cripple American trade (Nathaniel Cutting, 10 February 1794)
    - "The known and immediate agent in this infernal conspiracy against our peace and prosperity is at this instant walking in the Garden beneath my window, with all the apparent composure & self-complacency that can be inspired by successful villainy: Mr Logie, late the British Consul at Algiers, - who, unsolicited by the Court of Portugal, negotiated the fatal Truce which has eventually wrested from a considerable number of our industrious Citizens their Liberty, from others their property - and from some, both: - and probably has deprived their sympathizing Country & Connexions of the services of many of them forever! Mr Logie the other day in conversation with Colonel Humphreys had the impudence to attempt exculpating himself and the British Government from the blame cast upon them by every disinterested person, - and, so far as I can learn, by the Court of Portugul itself - for this nefarious and abominable transaction. He asserts that this Court earnestly prest him to it; but I do not believe him."
