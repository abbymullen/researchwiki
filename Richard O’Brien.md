- Captain of *Dolphin*

- [William Eaton]() really doesn't like O'Brien: "Extract of a letter to Mr. OBrien, inclosure B, is forwarded to show to Govt. how much we differ in opinion on the subject of the force necessary to terminate the war. He will have a cordon of frigates from Gibr. to Mahon. They would be equally necessary from Gibr: to America! In all his opinions on the provisions for and consequences of the war he seems to betray ignorance or design. Before I knew that he expected a successor I could resolve all his arguments on the subject into a fear he entertained that a rupture would obstruct the operations of his commerce with the Jew house. I can no other way account at present for the obstacles he would raise to the prosecution of the war but from the desire he feels of being consistent with himself. I hope his successor will be an American. I do not hesitate to allege that the most essential communications of Mr. OBrien relative to Barbary in General are gross misrepresentations calculated to bewilder and decieve rather than to instruct: and it is not uncharitable to believe that these misrepresentations are rather the effect of speculative views than of ignorance. Nothing could have been more erroneous and absurd than the insinuation that the Jews at Algiers have control in Tunis; and, as it respects foreign intercourse, the same remark applies to the Dey himself. These Regencies, in their operations abroad, are as independent of and disconnected with each other, as are the different states of Europe. If this assertion require evidence I will produce the Dey’s "Patron Grandi’s" guarantee of our peace with Tripoli." (William Eaton to James Madison, The Papers of James Madison Digital Edition, J. C.

- [James Leander Cathcart]() reports that O'Brien is a generally unlikeable and untrustworthy fellow, who has his own interests and nothing else at heart, and that he intends to make it difficult for anyone else to come after him in his consular duties: "Mr OBrion informed Capt John Shaw of the George Washington that he would be da-'d before he would leave a paper in the Office or give any Consul that would be appointed the least information that he might conduct our affairs as he pleases (and to make use of his own expression) that he might go to hell his own way" (25 January 1803, BW2:350)
