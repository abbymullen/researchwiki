[Yusuf Karamanli]() had to deal with more than just fractious and difficult negotiations with other nations; he also had to keep his own government intact. This was no small feat; Karamanli was a usurper and seems to have held his power relatively tenuously.

## [Coup in Tripoli]()
- [Hamet Karamanli](), Yusuf's brother, colluded with the American navy to attempt a coup

## Quashing rebellions
- BW2:486: [Nicholas Nissen]() reports that Yusuf is mounting an army against the inhabitants of the Guerrian mountains, who were revolting (15 July 1803)
- BW3:62: [Nicholas Nissen]() again, reports on how the bashaw is getting along with his plan: "The Bashaw has terminated the trouble at Guerrian partly by Negociation and partly by force of Arms, the Inhabitants have agreed to pay him an Indemnification of 100,000 dollars and to permit him to build a Castle & place a Garrison on their Mountain; the Bashaw is now sending an army to Derna to subdue his brother Hamet, who is in possession of half that Town, but the Coast & Harbour is in the hands of the Bashaw of Tripoli who has two Cruisers there one of 10 & the other of 12 Guns, to prevent his brother from having any communication with the Island of Malta. lately was captured at Derna and sent here a vessel belonging to Malta, which had gone there, notwithstanding the prohibition published by the British Government at Malta on the 4th of April in consequence of the Bashaws demand" (19 September 1803)
