[Yusuf Karamanli]() had to deal with more than just fractious and difficult negotiations with other nations; he also had to keep his own government intact. This was no small feat; Karamanli was a usurper and seems to have held his power relatively tenuously.

## [Coup in Tripoli]()
- [Hamet Karamanli](), Yusuf's brother, colluded with the American navy to attempt a coup

## Quashing rebellions
- BW2:486: [Nicholas Nissen]() reports that Yusuf is mounting an army against the inhabitants of the Guerrian mountains, who were revolting (15 July 1803)
