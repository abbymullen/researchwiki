## Andrew Morris

    - Nicholas Nissen intervened to set the captain at liberty in the town
    - Benjamin McDonough claimed 2 officers and a seaman as British subjects and freed them

    - Tripolitan xebec captured 9 men in an American brig off Cape Pallas on her way from Marseilles to America (BW2:194, 6 July 1802)
    - Brought to Bizerte, where [Guiseppe Manucie]() alerted [William Eaton]() of the capture
- [William Eaton]() is not allowed to speak to Morris; he has dire predictions about what might happen to the sailors when they reach Tripoli: "They will be carried to Tripoli, where they also will be cried for sale at public auction, like so many cattle; or, perhaps, stationed on the batteries to slay & be slain by their Countrymen" (BW2:196, 9 July 1802)
- Eaton recalls that there might be a possibility of prisoner exchange in Tripoli based on some Turkish prisoners the USA released in summer 1801, 11 July 1802 (BW2:201)
- [James Leander Cathcart]() also wants to redeem the crew, but notes that the brig itself and the cargo were lost--to try to regain those would set a "pernicious precedent" (BW2:204)
- [Alexander Murray]() notes the arrival of the two Tripolitan galleys that took the *Franklin* at Tripoli, but does not record that he in any way tried to give chase or attack said ships (BW2:207, 21 July 1802)
- [Alexander Murray]() reports that 2 of the crew escaped in a Greek boat during the skirmish between the [USS *Constellation*]() and the Tripolitan gun boats; 3 had been claimed by the British; so only 4 were left in captivity as of 20 August 1802 (BW2:242)    
- 22 September 1802: [Nicholas Nissen]() reports that the prisoners have been released and are on a ship on its way to Algiers; Nissen again went to bat for the American prisoners in  a big way; he requests reimbursement for the many things he purchased on their behalf (BW2:281-82) 
- 11 October 1802: [Richard O'Brien]() reports that Morris and 4 other seamen arrived in Algiers on 6 October, after (O'Brien says) the dey of Algiers requested their release; the dey then sent Morris et al. to O'Brien as a "present" to the United States (BW2:289)

# Captivity negotiations
Unable to negotiate for themselves because of lack of diplomatic standing with Tripoli, the USA had to rely on others to negotiate for captives' freedom and comfort

## Sweden
- BW1:469: "Should the Barbary Powers or either of them have made Captives of any of our Citizens, you will endeavor through the Swedish consul to afford them usual relief & comfort; for which purpose you are authorized to furnish, from the money you will have on board, or from your credit, what sum you may deem necessary."
