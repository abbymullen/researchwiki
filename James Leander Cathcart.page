- Appointed as consul to Algiers after [Richard O'Brien]() but the dey of Algiers would not recognize him; therefore he never assumed the position (BW2:128)
    - BW2:348: Cathcart feels that his blacklisting is due to [Richard O'Brien]() and the [House of Bacri]() "who are not desirous that any person should be appointed possessed of sufficient intelhgence to investigate their iniquitous practices and the Jews are particularly interested in wishing to have the Consul of the United States entirely dependent on them" (25 January 1803)
    - BW2:3379: Continues to complain about how O'Brien and the Bacris are conspiring against him (30 March 1803)
    - BW2:487: SecState writes: "From the information the President has received of the probability of impediments being thrown into the way of the negotiation with Tripoli from your personal unacceptableness to the Bashaw, he has thought proper to place the powers for that purpose, formerly vested in you, in the hands of Mr. Lear. It is by no means meant that you should consider this change as a disapprobation of your former conduct, which has been marked with zeal & fidelity, or that the circumstance on which it is founded is at all attributable to your fault. It is possible also that you will view it in some some degree in the light of an accomodation by relieving you from the uncertainty of residence to which you have for more than two years been subjected, and leaving you at leasure to take upon yourself the consulate of Tunis" (16 July 1803)
