## Encounter with [USS *Philadelphia*](), 26 August 1803
- [USS *Philadelphia*]() brings Mirboka to and discovers it has a prize, the *Celia*, which is American
- Mirboka claimed that they were helping the *Celia* and she was not a prize
- Mirboka did have a passport from [James Simpson]()
- Upon sending his first lieutenant on board to search for prisoners, [William Bainbridge]() discovered that there were in fact prisoners and the *Celia* was in fact captured
- "I made no hesitation in Capturing her after such proceedings on their part and Violation of the faith of Passports which ought to be Sacred"
- Took the crew on board the *Philadelphia*
- Bad weather meant they lost the prize several times during the night and spent the whole next day chasing her
- "The Moors Confess that they came out aCruising for the sole purpose of Capturing Americans to be sent to Tanger."
- Bainbridge writes: "I have recd a paper from them writen in Moorish which they say is their authority from the Govr of Tanger for so doing - I inclose this to John Gavino Esqr with a particular request to have it safely Conveyd to you that you may be informed of the Circumstance and act accordingly. I beleive the Govenour of Tanger is much disposed for Hostilities with the U. S., the Moorish Prisoners accuse him as the sole cause of their present Cituation. I sincerely hope that this Capture may be productive of good Effects to the U. S. with the Empr who may be assured that if he injustly goes to War with the U. S. he will loose every large Cruiser he has, & God grant that it may not in the least prove a disadvantage to you. My Officers and self have made it a Markd point to treat the Prisoners not only with the lenity that is due from Humanity but with particular attention of Civility to impress on their mind a favourable Opinion of the American Character"

## Diplomatic struggles
- [James Simpson]() to [Edward Preble](), 14 September 1803: "we must view that Gentleman [[William Bainbridge]()] meeting the Emperours Ship with the captured Brig in company as a very fortunate event, for thereby a most deceitful and criminal conduct towards the United States has been detected, and I trust will be so fully substantiated by the papers found on board the Cruizer and the Captain's declaration, as to put the matter past all doubt." (BW3:43-44)
    - Recommends interrogating the captain and crew to get to the bottom of things: "If he can be brought to state these particulars with the assistance of one of the Jews of Gibraltar acquainted with the Arabic Language it will be essentially usefull ; - if he of himself will not state such a declaration then in my oppinion the best way will be to bring him on board the Flag Ship and propose questions to him to the effect of what I have mentioned, if not inconsistent with your established Interrogations; and the like with one or two more of the principal persons of the Ship, without allowing either any opportmty of knowing what has passed with the others." (BW3:44)
