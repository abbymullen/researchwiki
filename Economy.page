## State of Mediterranean commerce after American Revolution
- ASP1FR1: Thomas Jefferson, *Mediterranean trade. Report of the Secretary of State relative to the Mediterranean trade. Communicated to the House of Representatives, December 30, 1790, and to the Senate, January 3, 1791.*

    - 104
        - Loss of customs houses in the Revolution meant lack of information about Med trade 
        - Before the war: 
	        - 1/6 of wheat/flour exported from USA -> Med
	        - 1/4 of pickled/dried fish exported (value) from USA -> Med
	        - some rice
        - During war: little to no trade
        - After war, realized that diplomatic measures would be needed to assure safe passage
	    - appointed ministers plenipotentiary who were sent to Algiers and Morocco (March 1785)
        - Morocco:
	        - liberal treaty agreed upon
	        - felt important because of potential for both Atlantic and Mediterranean disruption
	        - USA also engaged in trade WITH Morocco (true for other states?)
        - Algiers
	        - More belligerent, more aggressive
	        - Took two American ships and demanded ransom for their crews of $59,496
        - Tripoli
	        - Minister from Tripoli came to USA to demand treaty
	        - Tunis and Tripoli seen as of little importance while Algiers was not taken care of
        - Results: "Our navigation, then, into the Mediterranean has not been resumed at all since the peace. The sole obstacle has been the unprovoked war of Algiers, and the sole remedy must be to bring that war to an end, or to palliate its effects." {We know this is not strictly true---commerce does resume, but there don't appear to be any more official accountings of it}
        - Perceived differences between American trade and European trade: Europeans mostly have other entry points into the Med, but Americans must go through the Straits of Gibraltar no matter where their final destination (added vulnerability)
	        - Payment scheme of European nations: "in this instance counting their interest more than their honor"
