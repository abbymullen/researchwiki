Title: "Traversing all the Seas"

From [Thomas Jefferson]()'s [first inaugural address](https://jeffersonpapers.princeton.edu/selected-documents/first-inaugural-address-0): "A rising nation, spread over a wide and fruitful land, traversing all the seas with the rich productions of their industry, engaged in commerce with nations who feel power and forget right, advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye; when I contemplate these transcendent objects, and see the honour, the happiness, and the hopes of this beloved country committed to the issue and the auspices of this day, I shrink from the contemplation & humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking." 


## State of Mediterranean commerce after American Revolution
- ASP1FR1: Thomas Jefferson, *Mediterranean trade. Report of the Secretary of State relative to the Mediterranean trade. Communicated to the House of Representatives, December 30, 1790, and to the Senate, January 3, 1791.*

    - 104
        - Loss of customs houses in the Revolution meant lack of information about Med trade 
        - Before the war: 
	        - 1/6 of wheat/flour exported from USA -> Med
	        - 1/4 of pickled/dried fish exported (value) from USA -> Med
	        - some rice
        - During war: little to no trade
        - After war, realized that diplomatic measures would be needed to assure safe passage
	    - appointed ministers plenipotentiary who were sent to Algiers and Morocco (March 1785)
        - Morocco:
	        - liberal treaty agreed upon
	        - felt important because of potential for both Atlantic and Mediterranean disruption
	        - USA also engaged in trade WITH Morocco (true for other states?)
        - Algiers
	        - More belligerent, more aggressive
	        - Took two American ships and demanded ransom for their crews of $59,496
        - Tripoli
	        - Minister from Tripoli came to USA to demand treaty
	        - Tunis and Tripoli seen as of little importance while Algiers was not taken care of
        - Results: "Our navigation, then, into the Mediterranean has not been resumed at all since the peace. The sole obstacle has been the unprovoked war of Algiers, and the sole remedy must be to bring that war to an end, or to palliate its effects." {We know this is not strictly true---commerce does resume, but there don't appear to be any more official accountings of it}
        - Perceived differences between American trade and European trade: Europeans mostly have other entry points into the Med, but Americans must go through the Straits of Gibraltar no matter where their final destination (added vulnerability)
	        - Payment scheme of European nations: "in this instance counting their interest more than their honor"
	        
- BW1:397: [William Eaton]() to Sec of State, 1 November 1800: "The commerce of the United States in the Mediterranean, Mr. Appleton at Leghorn says, is nearly equal to that of all other carrying trades." [Surely he doesn't mean all the others put together?] 	        
	        
- ASP2FR2:462: James Leander Cathcart to Secretary of State, 4 July 1802
    - Extent of commerce: Cathcart says it is better than it has ever been--and more vulnerable
        - Up to 24 American ships in Leghorn at once in 1801, 2/3 unarmed
	- Cathcart therefore suggests that American ships must travel in convoy past Gibraltar (possibly with Swedish protection if no American protection is available)

- Notes from Lisbon about trade: "Trade from America, as you will readily conceive, is extremely dull"; notes that Lisbon has to get wheat from North Africa and doesn't get corn at all (*Philadelphia Gazette*, 1 April 1797)

- [Possible hint at how important Med commerce is:](http://infoweb.newsbank.com.ezproxy.bpl.org/iw-search/we/HistArchive/?p_product=EANX&p_theme=ahnp&p_nbid=S61N4ENEMTQ0MzQ0MzY1NC4yNjM1MDk6MToxMzoxOTIuODAuNjUuMTE2&p_action=doc&s_lastnonissuequeryname=5&d_viewref=search&p_queryname=5&p_docnum=43&p_docref=v2:109E8167B4F23EB8@EANX-10BC2AE497A4D370@2377074-10BC2AE80781F388@2-10BC2AE90EF1B6D0@From%20Lisbon)

- [John Shaw]() asserts that "I conseive -- our Commerc[e] with Italy will always be of great Importance to U S -- we will mostly finde good marts & good returns" (BW2:75, 2 March 1802)

- BW2:191: [James Leander Cathcart]() estimates that Mediterranean commerce has never been so strong, but that it is under threat because of lack of convoy: "From the returns of our consuls you will be informed of the extent of our commerce in this sea, which never was so valuable, as it was at the period and since the bashsw of Tripoli commenced hostilities. I have seen twenty-four sail of American vessels in this port at once last year, two-thirds of whom were unarmed" (4 July 1802). 

## Barriers to commerce: corsair tactics
- BW1:602: Report that some Tripoline corsairs have taken English papers and Minorcan crews in order to avoid search and seizure by the American squadron, 24 October 1801

# Insurance concerns

One of the reasons put forth by scholars about why American shipping was suffering was the high insurance premiums that would be levied if American ships were taken

- BW3:20: [James Simpson]() writes that one of his strong inducements to keep the peace with Morocco is "the Commerce might not meet interuption or be burthen'd with heavy Insurance beyond the actual Risque" (5 September 1803)
- 

## Merchants' fears
- American merchants want answers about the true state of affairs with Tripoli, as "A very large amount of American property is now afloat in the Mediterranean--and hundreds of our valuable seamen are there employed" (Maryland Gazette (Annapolis, Maryland), Thursday, May 28, 1801; Issue 2837)

## Potential
- [William Willis]() to [James Madison](), 24 June 1801: "“The trade of the mediterranean would at this moment employ one thousand sail of American vessels, & every vessel at the present rate of freight would clear themselves in twelve months. The proffits would be immense: for supposing these vessels to cost on an average ten thousand dollars, this would make a clear proffit of ten millions of dollars. There are now in a state of inactivity vessels belonging to Sweden & Denmark to nearly double that number which vessels are usually employed in the Mediterranean trade, and the Americans have now a fair chance of taking their places which they will inevitably hold if they once get possession of it. The Danes have become rich from the Mediterranean trade only, and little vilages that only five or six years ago owned eight or ten fishing boats, now own seventy or eighty sail of fine merchantmen. And besides the advantage of employing the huls of vessels the mediterranean furnishes the best market for much of the American produce, as well as the surplus West & East India goods imported into the United States. I know it is said by some that commerce is not worth protecting, and it is equal to the planter whether the foreigner comes to purchase his produce, or whether it is sent to market by his own countrymen. Let farmers in any district try the experiment in their inland trade, and wait for the people of a city to come out & purchase what they stand in need of & they will soon find that their more artful neighbours though at a greater distance will supply that city from their own farms while the produce of theirs will perish on their hands. And this will be our fate if we abandon our external commerce & wait for people of other countries to come & purchase what they want. Many nations are now supplied with the produce of the United States that would never come to our country for those supplies, but would receive the same kind or substitutes for them from the growth of other countries from the hands of more wise people. Experienc⟨e⟩ has shewn people of reflexion that nothing facilitates the sale of goods so much as carrying them to places where they are wanted & this is clearly proved both in external & internal commerce."
