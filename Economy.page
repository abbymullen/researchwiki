## State of Mediterranean commerce after American Revolution
- ASP1FR1: Thomas Jefferson, *Mediterranean trade. Report of the Secretary of State relative to the Mediterranean trade. Communicated to the House of Representatives, December 30, 1790, and to the Senate, January 3, 1791.*

    - 104
        - Loss of customs houses in the Revolution meant lack of information about Med trade 
        - Before the war: 
	        - 1/6 of wheat/flour exported from USA -> Med
	        - 1/4 of pickled/dried fish exported (value) from USA -> Med
	        - some rice
        - During war: little to no trade
        - After war, realized that diplomatic measures would be needed to assure safe passage
	    - appointed ministers plenipotentiary who were sent to Algiers and Morocco (March 1785)
        - Morocco:
	        - liberal treaty agreed upon
	        - felt important because of potential for both Atlantic and Mediterranean disruption
	        - USA also engaged in trade WITH Morocco (true for other states?)
        - Algiers
	        - More belligerent, more aggressive
	        - Took two American ships and demanded ransom for their crews of $59,496
        - Tripoli
	        - Minister from Tripoli came to USA to demand treaty
	        - Tunis and Tripoli seen as of little importance while Algiers was not taken care of
        - Results: "Our navigation, then, into the Mediterranean has not been resumed at all since the peace. The sole obstacle has been the unprovoked war of Algiers, and the sole remedy must be to bring that war to an end, or to palliate its effects." {We know this is not strictly true---commerce does resume, but there don't appear to be any more official accountings of it}
        - Perceived differences between American trade and European trade: Europeans mostly have other entry points into the Med, but Americans must go through the Straits of Gibraltar no matter where their final destination (added vulnerability)
	        - Payment scheme of European nations: "in this instance counting their interest more than their honor"
	        
- BW1:397: [William Eaton]() to Sec of State, 1 November 1800: "The commerce of the United States in the Mediterranean, Mr. Appleton at Leghorn says, is nearly equal to that of all other carrying trades." [Surely he doesn't mean all the others put together?] 	        
	        
- ASP2FR2:462: James Leander Cathcart to Secretary of State, 4 July 1802
    - Extent of commerce: Cathcart says it is better than it has ever been--and more vulnerable
        - Up to 24 American ships in Leghorn at once in 1801, 2/3 unarmed
	- Cathcart therefore suggests that American ships must travel in convoy past Gibraltar (possibly with Swedish protection if no American protection is available)

## Split duties
- Not only was the navy supposed to fight the war, but they were often also called upon for convoy duty, which was purely for the peace of mind of the American merchants in the Med.
