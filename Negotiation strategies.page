## Early ideas about how to deal with Barbary problem
- ASP1FR1:105: Differing ideas about how much a peace settlement would cost
    - Wolf (Irish): 60-70,000 pound sterling (with Algiers)
	- O'Brien (captive): $322,000 (peace with Algiers)
	- Tripoline ambassador: 90,000 pounds sterling (peace with three smaller powers); Algiers would ask for more--extrapolated by ministers plenipotentiary to $460,000-575,000 to Algiers
	- Anonymous source in Paris: peace could be bought for $1,000,000 minimum
    - Enforcement of treaty needed by "marine force . . . in their harbor from time to time"

## European practice
-  ASP1FR1:105: Payments
    - Spain: paid $3-5 million and still have ships taken with impunity
    - France: amount not known, but Barbary states perceived France's preoccupation with home affairs and took 6 ships
	- Holland and Denmark: roughly $24,000-30,000 in naval stores
	- Sweden and Venice: roughly $24,000-30,000 in money
	- Great Britain: possibly $280,000/year (though they are embarrassed and so keep their payments hidden from the public)
- ASP1FR1:107: John Adams to John Jay, 2/16/1786: Europeans send tribute and force simultaneously to ensure treaty is properly enforced

## Use of force
- ASP1FR1:105: Need to have force that matches Algerine force? Or do we just need a force to match some, since they rarely travel/cruise in unison?
	- Suggests a blockade using a single or a few vessels in front of Algiers during 8 temperate months, as Portugal has done before Gibraltar
- ASP1FR1:107: Richard O'Brien to TJ, 6/13/1789: Sees treaty-making with Algiers as impolitic while they take so many liberties with the treaties they already have
- BW1:401: [William Bainbridge]() to Sec of Navy, 17 November 1800: "I do not hesitate in saying, that 6 or 8 frigates in the Mediterranean Sea, would give us more permanent security, than any Treaty that can be made with the States of Barbary."
- BW1:581: [Richard O'Brien]() to Sec of State, 26 Sept 1801: "we want More frigates in This Sea--and our system with those states at war with the U states should be Severity--Any act of Lenity is considered by Them as -- an act of Timidity"
- BW2:112: [James Leander Cathcart](): "The President in his speech recommends coercive measures against Tripoli, the popular opinion so far as it is publickly declared, is millions for defense but not one cent for tribute" (10 April 1802)
- BW2:126: SecState suggests to [James Leander Cathcart]() that having the whole squadron stand off Tripoli while Cathcart is negotiating might give him a better chance of getting a good deal (18 April 1802)
    - Suggests waiting for the bashaw to respond to the show of force: "As it is evidently desireable, that the first overtures should come from the Bashaw, you will wait a reasonable time for the effect of his disposition on this subject, or of the
awe inspired by a display of our force before his eyes and his capital."
    - Payment cannot be part of the negotiations because payment to Tripoli would jeopardize their standing with Tunis, who has just finished being paid off (BW2:127)
    - Algiers must be taken out of any treaty as arbiter, but without making Algiers angry---make it look like it was the bashaw's idea to remove Algiers, not the USA's
    - [Sweden]() should be consulted about the treaty, but any treaty the USA negotiates must be viewed as completely separate from anything done by Sweden, and must be seen as done with no collusion between the two countries
    - If a treaty is made, a consul must be re-established, but as the bashaw is the one who removed the consulate in the first place, he must not expect any gifts to mark the arrival of a new consul---in the meantime, continue to rely on [Nicholas Nissen]() as a substitute
- BW2:130: SecNav to [Richard Valentine Morris](): "Holding out the olive Branch in one hand & displaying in the other the means of offensive operations, may produce a peaceful disposition towards us in the mind of the Bashaw, and essentially contribute to our obtaining an advantageous treaty with him" (20 April 1802).
- BW2:163: [Alexander Murray]() writes that "it is not amiss to shew those Folks [Tunisians] our Ships, now, & then, they are powerful advocates in our favor" (1 June 1802)

# Use of payment
## Price of settlement
- BW1:149: Joel Barlow to Secretary of State, 20 April 1796: "One ship a year taken by them [Algiers] would amount to a sum equal to maintaining a peace. And they have taken in this way enough to average one ship a year since the American war."

## Benefits of settlement

## Specific negotiations
- [Algiers]()
- [Tunis]()
- [Tripoli]()
- [Morocco]()

# Keeping the peace
- BW1:394-95: [James Leander Cathcart]() to Charles Lee, sec of state, 1 November 1800: Cathcart petitioned the dey of Algiers to intervene against Tripoli's breaking their treaty with the USA, but does not express much hope that anything will be done
