## Early ideas about how to deal with Barbary problem
- ASP1FR1:105: Differing ideas about how much a peace settlement would cost
    - Wolf (Irish): 60-70,000 pound sterling (with Algiers)
	- O'Brien (captive): $322,000 (peace with Algiers)
	- Tripoline ambassador: 90,000 pounds sterling (peace with three smaller powers); Algiers would ask for more--extrapolated by ministers plenipotentiary to $460,000-575,000 to Algiers
	- Anonymous source in Paris: peace could be bought for $1,000,000 minimum
    - Enforcement of treaty needed by "marine force . . . in their harbor from time to time"

## European practice
-  ASP1FR1:105: Payments
    - Spain: paid $3-5 million and still have ships taken with impunity
    - France: amount not known, but Barbary states perceived France's preoccupation with home affairs and took 6 ships
	- Holland and Denmark: roughly $24,000-30,000 in naval stores
	- Sweden and Venice: roughly $24,000-30,000 in money
	- Great Britain: possibly $280,000/year (though they are embarrassed and so keep their payments hidden from the public)
- ASP1FR1:107: John Adams to John Jay, 2/16/1786: Europeans send tribute and force simultaneously to ensure treaty is properly enforced

## Use of force
- ASP1FR1:105: Need to have force that matches Algerine force? Or do we just need a force to match some, since they rarely travel/cruise in unison?
	- Suggests a blockade using a single or a few vessels in front of Algiers during 8 temperate months, as Portugal has done before Gibraltar
- ASP1FR1:107: Richard O'Brien to TJ, 6/13/1789: Sees treaty-making with Algiers as impolitic while they take so many liberties with the treaties they already have

# Use of payment
## Price of settlement
- BW1:149: Joel Barlow to Secretary of State, 20 April 1796: "One ship a year taken by them [Algiers] would amount to a sum equal to maintaining a peace. And they have taken in this way enough to average one ship a year since the American war."
