## Early ideas about how to deal with Barbary problem
- ASP1FR1:105: Differing ideas about how much a peace settlement would cost
    - Wolf (Irish): 60-70,000 pound sterling (with Algiers)
	- O'Brien (captive): $322,000 (peace with Algiers)
	- Tripoline ambassador: 90,000 pounds sterling (peace with three smaller powers); Algiers would ask for more--extrapolated by ministers plenipotentiary to $460,000-575,000 to Algiers
	- Anonymous source in Paris: peace could be bought for $1,000,000 minimum
    - Enforcement of treaty needed by "marine force . . . in their harbor from time to time"

## European practice
-  ASP1FR1:105: Payments
    - Spain: paid $3-5 million and still have ships taken with impunity
    - France: amount not known, but Barbary states perceived France's preoccupation with home affairs and took 6 ships
	- Holland and Denmark: roughly $24,000-30,000 in naval stores
	- Sweden and Venice: roughly $24,000-30,000 in money
	- Great Britain: possibly $280,000/year (though they are embarrassed and so keep their payments hidden from the public)
- ASP1FR1:107: John Adams to John Jay, 2/16/1786: Europeans send tribute and force simultaneously to ensure treaty is properly enforced
- BW2:278: [Alexander Murray](): "Policy dictates the surer, tho not the most dignified, custom of paying Tribute, or given douceurs, which I believe every Nation in Europe doth, 'tho at this time the French Republic hath a squadron of two Ships of the line, a Frigate, & Corvette at Tunis, which are acting upon proper grounds, & make Peece upon their terms, they make a great parade, & are striving for a monopolizement of the Mediterranean Commerce, for the Seas are now covered with their Vessels, how then, situated as we are, can we expect to stand almost alone in this Warfare" (18 September 1802)
- BW2:289-90: [Richard O'Brien]() details the various things Europeans have done to buy peace with Tripoli, October 1802:
    -  "dean [Danish] commodore in august to prevent a war with Tripoli has given the Pascha of tripoli the Sum of 30 Thsd dollars for 5 years peace and an Annuity of 5 Thousd dollars and presents Supose Thus The 5 years will cost denmark The Sum of 60 thousand dollars"
    -  The French negotiated a peace between Sweden and Tripoli, for the amount of $130,000 (including the release of captives)
    -  Dutch will likely pay out the same as the Danes, says O'Brien
    -  French under Bonaparte have given a corsair of 14 guns, plus presents--in all, worth about $25,000

## Price of settlement
- BW1:149: Joel Barlow to Secretary of State, 20 April 1796: "One ship a year taken by them [Algiers] would amount to a sum equal to maintaining a peace. And they have taken in this way enough to average one ship a year since the American war."

# Keeping the peace
- BW1:394-95: [James Leander Cathcart]() to Charles Lee, sec of state, 1 November 1800: Cathcart petitioned the dey of Algiers to intervene against Tripoli's breaking their treaty with the USA, but does not express much hope that anything will be done
- BW2:232: SecNav informs [Richard Valentine Morris]() that the [USS *New York*]() is bringing him $20,000-30,000 to be dispensed to whichever Barbary state might need temporary conciliation (13 August 1802)
