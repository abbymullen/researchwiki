- The Navy employed hundreds of men, not just seaman (skilled or otherwise) but also dock workers of all kinds. 

- BW2:452: [Charles Stewart]() reports that the carpenters working on the [USS *Siren*]() "has demanded an increase of pay & none of them has done any work since saturday last this is an unavoidable accident & if they do not return to thier work, it will make a considerable difference in the time of lanching" (15 June 1803)
- BW2:494: [Edward Preble]() reports that a rise in the wages of merchant sailors has caused him difficulty in recruiting: " The men we have engaged here, are not such as I wish wages are so high in the merchant service that the best men will not ship with us - I do not believe that I have twenty native American Sailors on board" (21 July 1803) 
- BW3:167: [Edward Preble]() has to renegotiate the terms of enlistment for some sailors to whom [Richard Valentine Morris]() for some reason promised discharge after 6 months instead of the usual 12: "In consequence of an imprudent promise made by Commodore Morris to the present Crew of the Enterprize, entered at Gibraltar last May, that they should be discharged in six months although they must ship for twelve; much difficulty has arisen, however they have in consequence of a small advance to each, [agreed] to remain untill the expiration of the time they shiped for, which will expire next April. She will then at the time when I shall most want her services be left destitute of at least half and I think probable more than that proportion of her crew, as many of them will insist on returning home; and I do not see any probability of procuring men in the Mediterranean to replace them. I therefore think it is absolutely necessary that 50 Men at least should be sent out for the purpose of compleating her crew." (30 October 1803)
