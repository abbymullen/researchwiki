- [USS *Essex*]() encounters a ship thought to be Tripolitan (because they're wearing turbans!). After firing into the vessel, discovered it to be Moroccan of Tangier. Essex's doctor goes on board the ship to bind up the man wounded by Essex's fire and then both ships go their way. (BW1:551)
- [Richard Dale]() urges [William Eaton]() to make sure the Tunisians have appropriate papers from the government to avoid detention and capture by the American squadron, since he can't tell Tunisians and Tripolitans apart on sight, and he has not been restrictive enough in the past (BW1:556)
- [Richard O'Brien]() informs the Secretary of State that Algiers has requested that he issue passports for the crews of the Tripolitan vessels blockaded at Gibraltar by the navy. He declines, reminding the dey that he wouldn't want to set a precedent of breaking the customary blockading practices, as it might come back to bite Algiers. 26 Sept 1801 (BW1:581)


## Passports
Passports were a sticking point between the USA and all of the Barbary regencies. I'm still not quite sure how the system worked, since half of the passport was kept on shore and the other half was purportedly given to ships' captains; did all ships in a navy get a stack of passports? Did they go through them every time they stopped a ship? These things seem unlikely. But giving or withholding passports seems to have been a potent form of diplomatic power, even though there was trickery and skepticism on both sides about the legitimacy of passes.

(This also leads me to believe that the volume of ship traffic was not extraordinarily high, if they could issue a passport to every single ship coming into the Med.)

- Example of using passports for diplomatic force: [Richard O'Brien]() refused to issue passports to Algiers for Tripolitan ships docked in an Algerian port; therefore he did not wish to ask the Dey of Algiers for a passport for the *Peace and Plenty*, delivering tribute payments to Tunis. Therefore, the *George Washington* had to convoy the *Peace and Plenty* to Tunis in order to prevent capture.
    - O'Brien did not like this; he wanted to show "him and his Ministry both Turkish and Jewish ... that we finally would make force to be our passport." (BW1:616, 8 Nov 1801)
    - 
- [Richard O'Brien]() complains to the Secretary of State that the passports issued to American merchants are defective, because their parts don't match the part the Algerian corsairs have; other nations with this problem have had vessels' cargo condemned (25 November 1801, BW1:625)

## Other nations' relations with the Barbary states
- BW2:67: [Nicholas Nissen]() expresses surprise at how the Swedish ships have taken hostile action against Tripoli while they are still technically at peace with Tripoli, 21 April 1802
    - Nissen further suggests that Sweden has asked France to be mediator for them with the Barbary states, but thinks it will be a difficult negotiation because of the cavalier attitude of the Swedish navy toward attacking Tunisian ships
    - 22 April: Negotiations, though secret, appear to be broken down between Sweden, the French mediator, and the bashaw
    - 22 April: the bashaw seems to be arming for a fight---Nissen thinks he fears something more formidable than Sweden or the USA


## Morocco
- Morocco also wants to do something about the ships blockaded at Gibraltar. The Emperor of Morocco requested that the ships be given a passport to go home. [Richard Dale]() writes to [James Simpson]() in response: "You will please to Inform the Governor of Tangier, that the U.S. did not make war against the Bey of Tripoli; the Bey of Tripoli made war against the U.S. without any caus what ever on the part of the United States it is the wish of the President, to be at peace, and in friendship, with all nations, But as the Bey of Tripoli has made war without any cause, it is my duty, to take and detain his corsairs where ever I find them, nor do I think the good Since of His Highness the Emperor of Morocco, will permitt him to think that I have done wrong in so doing" (BW2:78, 4 March 1802)
- [Richard Dale]() is still concerned about Morocco, though: he writes to [James Simpson]() that he should see the emperor of Morocco personally in order to "do away if possible those unjust Ideas that the Tripoline Ambassador has empressed on his mind, in favour of his Master, to the prejudice of the United States, ... it appears to me that the Emperor is desided in taking part with the Bey of Tripoli, how far he intends to go I cannot tell, it is very much, to be dreaded, his going to war with the United States, he can do us more Injury than all the other powers put together, therefore we must do every thing we can to keep peace with him" (BW2:81)
- [James Simpson]() writes to Sec of State that he has not taken the hard line Dale recommended with the emperor of Morocco, regarding the passports for the Tripolitan ship; instead, he has demurred by saying Dale did not have time to discuss it with the Swedish admiral before he was forced to return home, so the emperor would have to wait for a decision until Dale's successor arrived and could speak to [Soderstrom](). " At all events it certainly is Best, should the request be ultimately found such as cannot be granted? that Sweden join in the refusal, as it can do no good that the United States come forward alone with such, before Admiral Cederstroms sentiments be known." (BW2:92, 19 March 1802)
- BW2:114: SecNav informs [Richard Valentine Morris]() of the state of affairs with Morocco and requests, "We should be very much wanting in our duty, if these circumstances did not excite a precautionary vigilance with respect to the Emperor's movements. They may eventuate in an open declaration of hostilities which we ought to be seasonably prepared to meet. I request you therefore by all proper means, to inform yourself of all the Emperor's movements & do not fail to give me full and frequent information on the subject" (13 April 1802)

## Tunis
- List of presents to the bey of Tunis:
    - A gun mounted with a golden barrel and a mahogany crimson-velvet-lined case (L525)
    - Diamonds and emeralds for the gun (L345)
    - Pair of pistols, golden, with mahogany crimson-velvet-lined case (L525)
    - Diamonds and emeralds for the pistols (L212)
    - 5 mounted guns with embossing, etc., with mahogany crimson-velvet-lined case (L2100)
    - 5 Pairs of golden pistols, etc. (L2100)
    - (List provided by [Rufus King](), 15 March 1802, BW2:86)
- BW2:134: [William Eaton]() gets in a tiff with the bey of Tunis; the bey told Eaton to pack his bags, whereupon Eaton refused to grant any more passports for Tunisian vessels. The bey averred that he wanted peace, and that he did not think Eaton was as inclined toward peace as he was; "they must have a Consul with less fantasia & more friendly to the Barbary interests." Eaton replied that he was anticipating leaving very soon, and being replaced by [James Leander Cathcart](), but the bey said that Cathcart was not welcome in Tunis, 26 April 1802
