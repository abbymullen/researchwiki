- [USS *Essex*]() encounters a ship thought to be Tripolitan (because they're wearing turbans!). After firing into the vessel, discovered it to be Moroccan of Tangier. Essex's doctor goes on board the ship to bind up the man wounded by Essex's fire and then both ships go their way. (BW1:551)
- [Richard Dale]() urges [William Eaton]() to make sure the Tunisians have appropriate papers from the government to avoid detention and capture by the American squadron, since he can't tell Tunisians and Tripolitans apart on sight, and he has not been restrictive enough in the past (BW1:556)
- [Richard O'Brien]() informs the Secretary of State that Algiers has requested that he issue passports for the crews of the Tripolitan vessels blockaded at Gibraltar by the navy. He declines, reminding the dey that he wouldn't want to set a precedent of breaking the customary blockading practices, as it might come back to bite Algiers. 26 Sept 1801 (BW1:581)

## Passports
Passports were a sticking point between the USA and all of the Barbary regencies. I'm still not quite sure how the system worked, since half of the passport was kept on shore and the other half was purportedly given to ships' captains; did all ships in a navy get a stack of passports? Did they go through them every time they stopped a ship? These things seem unlikely. But giving or withholding passports seems to have been a potent form of diplomatic power, even though there was trickery and skepticism on both sides about the legitimacy of passes.

(This also leads me to believe that the volume of ship traffic was not extraordinarily high, if they could issue a passport to every single ship coming into the Med.)

- Example of using passports for diplomatic force: [Richard O'Brien]() refused to issue passports to Algiers for Tripolitan ships docked in an Algerian port; therefore he did not wish to ask the Dey of Algiers for a passport for the *Peace and Plenty*, delivering tribute payments to Tunis. Therefore, the *George Washington* had to convoy the *Peace and Plenty* to Tunis in order to prevent capture.
    - O'Brien did not like this; he wanted to show "him and his Ministry both Turkish and Jewish ... that we finally would make force to be our passport." (BW1:616, 8 Nov 1801)

- [Richard O'Brien]() complains to the Secretary of State that the passports issued to American merchants are defective, because their parts don't match the part the Algerian corsairs have; other nations with this problem have had vessels' cargo condemned (25 November 1801, BW1:625)
