- [USS *Essex*]() encounters a ship thought to be Tripolitan (because they're wearing turbans!). After firing into the vessel, discovered it to be Moroccan of Tangier. Essex's doctor goes on board the ship to bind up the man wounded by Essex's fire and then both ships go their way. (BW1:551)
- [Richard Dale]() urges [William Eaton]() to make sure the Tunisians have appropriate papers from the government to avoid detention and capture by the American squadron, since he can't tell Tunisians and Tripolitans apart on sight, and he has not been restrictive enough in the past (BW1:556)

- BW2:197: [William Eaton]() cautions against paying Tripoli off because he argues that the other Barbary states will then begin to demand fresh payment as well: "The moment we subscribe to the demands of Tripoli we shall have Tunis and Algiers, in a more imperious tone, demanding mope substantial proofs of the veritable friendship of the President of the United States!- Does not all experience prove to us that these States, when under no restraint of fear, never want a pretext for war where they have a prospect of gratifying their avance? And what guarantee have we against this spirit of rapine more than any other tributary nations?" (9 July 1802) 


## Passports
Passports were a sticking point between the USA and all of the Barbary regencies. I'm still not quite sure how the system worked, since half of the passport was kept on shore and the other half was purportedly given to ships' captains; did all ships in a navy get a stack of passports? Did they go through them every time they stopped a ship? These things seem unlikely. But giving or withholding passports seems to have been a potent form of diplomatic power, even though there was trickery and skepticism on both sides about the legitimacy of passes.

(This also leads me to believe that the volume of ship traffic was not extraordinarily high, if they could issue a passport to every single ship coming into the Med.)

- Example of using passports for diplomatic force: [Richard O'Brien]() refused to issue passports to Algiers for Tripolitan ships docked in an Algerian port; therefore he did not wish to ask the Dey of Algiers for a passport for the *Peace and Plenty*, delivering tribute payments to Tunis. Therefore, the *George Washington* had to convoy the *Peace and Plenty* to Tunis in order to prevent capture.
    - O'Brien did not like this; he wanted to show "him and his Ministry both Turkish and Jewish ... that we finally would make force to be our passport." (BW1:616, 8 Nov 1801)
    - 
- [Richard O'Brien]() complains to the Secretary of State that the passports issued to American merchants are defective, because their parts don't match the part the Algerian corsairs have; other nations with this problem have had vessels' cargo condemned (25 November 1801, BW1:625)
- - [Richard O'Brien]() informs the Secretary of State that Algiers has requested that he issue passports for the crews of the Tripolitan vessels blockaded at Gibraltar by the navy. He declines, reminding the dey that he wouldn't want to set a precedent of breaking the customary blockading practices, as it might come back to bite Algiers. 26 Sept 1801 (BW1:581)
- After [Richard Dale]() and then [Richard Valentine Morris]() refuse to grant passports to Morocco to allow wheat ships to Tripoli, [James Simpson]() informs them that he may have to leave Morocco, and also that no ship should go through the Straits unconvoyed (BW2:179, 17 June 1802)
    - Simpson wonders whether it would be better to just give Morocco their wheat ship passports, rather than causing panic amongst insurance companies that could cause them to raise their rates and engender real commercial problems for ships in the Mediterranean (BW2:182, 17 June 1802)
    - [Richard Valentine Morris]() points out that it would be foolish to blockade a port if they just let in ships with supplies from neighboring nations; he declines the passports once again, but asks for a little leniency as he expects orders from the SecNav soon (BW2:182, 19 June 1802)
    - [James Simpson]() was indeed forced to retire from Morocco as consul, 25 June 1802 (BW2:183); he issues a circular warning all ships not to travel through the Straits unconvoyed
- BW2:296: [Richard Valentine Morris](), hearing from [Alexander Murray]() that there is plenty of bread in Tripoli and provisions are cheap, authorizes passports for Moroccan ships wanting to carry wheat to Tripoli, reasoning that it won't make that much difference for Tripoli but it might smooth over relations with Morocco, 15 October 1802
- BW2:456: [James Simpson]() writes about passport given to the *Meshouda*: "Entrance into blockaded Ports I was specialy carefull to restrain by the Passport given for the Meshouda, as that has been violated we are to consider what has been the conduct towards other Vessels in same prediccament since the blockade of Tripoly has existed, I believe it has been to turn them away on the first attempt" (20 June 1803)
- BW3:23: [Tobias Lear]() has to go and verify that the passport issued to the *Maimona* of Morocco was legitimate (he does in fact verify the handwriting and seal on the passport as genuine) (7 September 1803)

## Other nations' relations with the Barbary states
- BW2:67: [Nicholas Nissen]() expresses surprise at how the Swedish ships have taken hostile action against Tripoli while they are still technically at peace with Tripoli, 21 April 1802
    - Nissen further suggests that Sweden has asked France to be mediator for them with the Barbary states, but thinks it will be a difficult negotiation because of the cavalier attitude of the Swedish navy toward attacking Tunisian ships
    - 22 April: Negotiations, though secret, appear to be broken down between Sweden, the French mediator, and the bashaw
    - 22 April: the bashaw seems to be arming for a fight---Nissen thinks he fears something more formidable than Sweden or the USA
- BW2:148: [Nicholas Nissen]() keeps [James Leander Cathcart]() informed of how the Swedish negotiations with Tripoli are going
