### 1802 cruise
- Captain: Alexander Murray
- Sailed from New Castle 13 March 1802 (BW2:83)
- Keeper of the log is not a very good navigator, as evidenced by his candid admission in the log that he messed up in his taking of bearings: "The only wa I can account for my reckoning being so far to the E.'d is our only allowing 45 feet for a Knot ; instead of 48 which would have made me nearly right." (BW2:133, 22 April 1802)
