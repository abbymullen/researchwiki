The Americans were sensitive to being compared to other nations, or being treated like other nations. They wanted to deal with the Barbary states and the Europeans on their own terms, though in their heart of hearts they probably knew that was impossible.

## Comparisons with all of Europe
- BW2:287: [James Leander Cathcart]() urges the Secretary of State to recommend more dispatch in dealings with Tripoli, "otherwise we will ultimately lose the little importance we have taken such pains to assume, & will be treated in the same stile of contempt that the Danes & Swedes are, & the Bashaw of Tripoli will have the satisfaction to find his words verified (i e) "the Americans will do like other nations, they will talk a great deal & do nothing, & at last come cap in hand& sue for peace upon my own terms!" (8 October 1802)
    - BW2:350: Cathcart reiterates his concern: "if we do not act with more energy, dispatch, and decision than we have done, that we will very soon loose the little importance we have taken such pains to assume and will ultimately sink into contempt and be treated in the same unworthy manner that the Danes & Sweedes are" (25 January 1803) (See also [Honor]().)
