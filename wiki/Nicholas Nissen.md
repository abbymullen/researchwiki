Nicholas C. Nissen seems to have been the Americans' man on the ground in Tripoli from the beginning. When the American diplomats were kicked out of Tripoli's court, Nissen became their go-between with the bashaw.

- 28 July 1801: [Richard Dale]() writes to Nissen asking him to get the bey (the bashaw?) to explain why he has broken faith---this seems like a job for an American diplomat, but Nissen was the best they had.
- 2 September 1801: Dale asks Nissen to negotiate a prisoner exchange with Tripoli (BW1:568)
- 31 August 1802: Despite Nissen's telling the navy that he could no longer act as their charge d'affaires, [James Leander Cathcart]() continues to use him to carry messages to the bashaw, specifically about the exchange of prisoners from the *Franklin*]() (BW2:261)
- 29 November 1802: [James Leander Cathcart](): "Commodore Koefoed, when he settled the affairs of Denmark, with the Regency of Tripoli made it an article of his Convention, with that Regency, that Mr. Nissen should no longer remain encharged with the affairs of the United States, in direct violation of his Masters Orders, as specified in a letter which Mr. Eaton received from the Chamber of Commerce of Copenhagen last year. Consequently it is beneath our dignity to solicit his good Offices longer than is absolutely necessary; but I must do him the justice to assert, that he has behaved towards us with unequivocal integrity, and merits the sentiments the President has pleased to cherish for him."

- 30 August 1803: [James Leander Cathcart]() recommends a letter of thanks and a $500-600 snuff box as a gift to Nissen for his help (BW2:525)
