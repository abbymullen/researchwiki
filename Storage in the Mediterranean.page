- Storage at Gibraltar: "It will be proper for you [[Richard Dale]()] to touch at Gibraltar & obtain permission from the Governor for depositing Provisions there, for the use of your squadron. It is not presumed there will be any refusal; but should he deem it improper, you will then leave a letter with Mr Gavino the American Consul, for the Captain of the Provision Vessel, that will be sent hereafter, directing him where to proceed" (BW1:465)
