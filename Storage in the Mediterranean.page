- Storage at Gibraltar: "It will be proper for you [[Richard Dale]()] to touch at Gibraltar & obtain permission from the Governor for depositing Provisions there, for the use of your squadron. It is not presumed there will be any refusal; but should he deem it improper, you will then leave a letter with Mr Gavino the American Consul, for the Captain of the Provision Vessel, that will be sent hereafter, directing him where to proceed" (BW1:465)
- Consular duty to make sure stores go to the right place: [Richard Dale]() charges [Patrick Mullony](), vice consul at Algeciras, with the task of getting the stores to the [USS Philadelphia]() and the [USS Essex]() when they come in, and preventing thievery of the stores in the meantime (BW1:603)
