- In 1794, the *Philadelphia Gazette* published notes from a session of Congress: "The first of these was, whether the Algerines acted from their own impulse in this business. In that case, they were known to be in the habit of selling a peace; and if they are willing to do so, he fancied that it might be purchased for less money than the armament would cost. On the other hand, if they do not act from their own impulse, but upon the instigation of Britain, we may depend upon it, that they cannot be bought. Britain will keep them hostile." (Philadelphia Gazette, 7 February 1794, America's Historical Newspapers)

- In 1797, [David Humphreys]() instructed to use French as mediators for negotiations with Algiers; he solicited their help, but he also deputed [Joseph Donaldson]() to negotiate and Donaldson chose not to wait for the French to sign a treaty (*Gazette of the United States*, 25 January 1797)
    - *Gazette* reports that it turned out for the best that the French weren't involved, as the consul wasn't in the dey's good graces at the moment

## Why is Algiers seen as the "principal" Barbary state?
-   Possibly because of French ties or sympathy for more egalitarian form of government? See IAN COLLER, “Barbary and Revolution: France and North Africa, 1789-1798,” in French Mediterraneans, Transnational and Imperial Histories (University of Nebraska Press, 2016), 67-69, http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d8h8t4.7.


## Negotiations
- BW1:451-52: [Richard O'Brien]() writes to SecState that the USA is "two &c a half Years in arrears in the Annuities we are threatened with war if The Stores does not arrive Shortly" (12 May 1801)

- BW2:212: SecState sends to [James Leander Cathcart]() $30,000, whihc he hopes Algiers will accept in lieu of $30,000 worth of stores, and he requests Cathcart try to negotiate for money instead of stores as payment henceforth (27 July 1802)
- BW2:289: The dey of Algiers refuses to accept [James Leander Cathcart]() as a replacement for [Richard O'Brien]() as consul; "he wanted here an american with a clean face. That he would never accept of any such character and that he would write a letter by Capt Morris [[Andrew Morris]()] to the President of The U States and for me to explain fully his Motives for objecting to receive Mr Cathcart. that he was an Enemie to Algiers and tripoli and of course not a fit person as agent for the U States in Barbary" (11 October 1802) 
    - BW2:301: The dey of Algiers writes to [Thomas Jefferson]() himself to say that he will not accept [James Leander Cathcart]() as consul: "his Character does not Suit us as we know wherever he has remained that he has created difficulties. and brought on a war And as I will not receive him I am shure it will be well for both nations"  (17 October 1802)
- BW2:298: [William Eaton]() views Algiers's interest in brokering a treaty as eminently self-interested: "I conclude that the present interference of that Regency is unsolicited; a project of the Jews to get an ascendancy in our affairs in all these Regencies: a project which they have assiduously and perseveringly labored to effect ever since the U States have been shown here as a nation - a project calculated to keep us in perpetual embroils with the other regencies, at the same time that it destroys the idea of our national independence at Algiers, and imposes on US an imaginary obligation there which is thought never to be sufficiently compensated" (16 October 1802)
- BW2:321: [Richard O'Brien]() brings $30,000 to Algiers in lieu of the stores they are supposed to bring for payment; the dey wants stores and will not accept the cash. The dey gave O'Brien 3 months to come up with the stores (23 November 1802)
- BW2:356-57: [Richard O'Brien]() reiterates that the dey has made demands of stores instead of cash; "I think it further prudent our Commerce should be on its Guard against a sudden surprize"
    - O'Brien details how capricious the dey of Algiers can be, as he declared war against France and Denmark one day, but the next day decided their consuls could stay longer, while revoking the agreement he had made with the agent of Bonaparte (2 February 1803)
    - SecNav realizes that Algiers is in earnest about wanting stores instead of money; thus he writes to [Israel Whelen](), purveyor at Philadelphia, to see what articles the dey wants and whether they can be found at Philadelphia (26 March 1803, BW2:377)
    - [James Leander Cathcart]() reports that [Richard O'Brien]() said that the dey kept the $30,000 offered in place of stores, but said it was not sufficient; when stores arrive, that may help to convince the dey that the next year's payment could be partially in cash and partially in stores
        - Dey was upset that he had not yet received any wood, which he needed to finish his cruiser
        - Dey said he better not make him mad, as he was negotiating a treaty with Portugal that might allow Algerian cruisers out into the Atlantic; Cathcart said that the "tragedy of 1793" would not happen again as long as the USA had warships to oppose him {not sure what the tragedy of 1793 is} (30 March 1803, BW2:379-80)
- BW2:380: [James Leander Cathcart]() sees [Richard O'Brien]() as part of the reason the negotiations with Algiers aren't going well: "so long as we continue to acquiesce in every demand of that Regency that he is the most proper person to remam there, lt may cost us a few thousand dollars per annum more than is necessary to maintain our peace, but we shall be under no apprehensions from his energy or sense of national dignity for he is literally the echo of the Jewish Sanhedrin who are the Creatures of the Dey" (30 March 1803)
- BW2:406: SecNav orders Daniel Bedinger to take timber from the 74 that's being built in order to pay Algiers the timber they want (14 May 1803)
- BW2:483: SecNav gives orders to [Tobias Lear]() about how to negotiate with Algiers, including how to determine when and what the presents must be (14 July 1803)
- BW3:132: The dey of Algiers writes to Thomas Jefferson demanding 10 24-pounder guns plus carriages, 5 18-pounders with carriages, and 60,000 bricks; [Richard O'Brien]() had refused, apparently, to write making this demand, so the dey went directly to the source; in return, the dey promised, "[I] request for our friendship and our treaty That you will not write me evasive to my demand - as any favour demanded on your part I shall comply therewith. whether your demand is great or small" (14 October 1803)
    - "On 13 Oct., Mustafa sent word to O’Brien that he wanted 40 guns, half of them 24-pounders and half of them 18-pounders. The consul pointed out that the United States government had responded to a similar request five years earlier by stating that it possessed no brass cannons and did not manufacture them. In an audience at the palace on 14 Oct., however, Mustafa insisted that O’Brien write to his government. O’Brien reported the conversation in a dispatch to Madison. “I will,” the dey told him, “have none of yr. excuses. You must acquise.” O’Brien advised the dey to request iron artillery pieces instead of brass ones, but Mustafa declined, saying “I have plenty of Iron guns.” Mustafa finally declared that he would write to the U.S. government himself “and make the demand of yr. Govt. and let me see if They refuse me.” O’Brien informed Madison that the dey had requested cannons from several other foreign consuls also ([Madison, Papers, Sec. of State Ser.], 5:517-19)."

    - O'Brien writes to the secretary of state outlining all the different ways that both providing the cannon and not providing them could come back to bite them in the butt. His solution: build 74s and 6 more frigates. " We
shall have to do it at last - if some great Event of Europe does not
Curb the pride avarice & System of Barbary" (BW3:134-35, 15 October 1803)
