- BW1:429: [Samuel Smith]() to [Thomas Truxtun](), 10 April 1801: "The Object of the squadron are instructions to our young Officers or to carry into Execution the Law fixing the Peace Establishment of the U. S. It is Concieved also that such a squadron Cruizing in view of the Barbary Powers will have a tendency to revent them from seizing on our commerce, whenever Passion or a desire of Plunder might Incite them thereto."

# Purpose of cruises
## [Cruise 1 (Richard Dale)]()
In the orders of this cruise, it seems pretty clear that the government feels it likely that the temporary declaration of war with Tripoli will be revoked by the time the squadron gets there; hence the couching of the orders mostly in terms of instruction and encouragement--the president and secretary of the navy genuinely think a blockade will not be necessary. (See BW1:471, Secretary of State to [Rufus King](), 21 May 1801)

This feeling of pointlessness was shared by the crew as well, e.g., [William Turner](), surgeon for the *Philadelphia*: "I Presume we shall Have very little to do & what I learn of the Disposion of the Commodore He will Indulge the different Ships, under His Command with the Gratification of visiting most of the Ports in the Levant Smyrna Constantinople, Egypt &c - The French Ports Particularly" (BW1:480).

Dale wanted to keep a ship off Tripoli at all times (see BW1:521), but this desire proved impossible to fulfill.

By the end of the first cruise, Dale had a different perspective: "It is very pleasing to me, that you should think, that the Squadron under my command has been so arranged, and conducted, as to have baffled the Intentions, of thc Bey of Tripoli and his Admiral, It has been my pride, from the first of my arrival in those Seas, as well as the Commanders that I have had the Honor to Command, to Empress on the minds of those people, also, the European Nations, what the Government of the United States can do - and will do, I hope, when drove to act in a hostile manner" (BW1:611, letter to [David Humphreys](), 28 October 1801). 

## Cruise 2: 1802
- Secretary of the navy solidifies the blockade strategy: "The most effectual plan for accomplishing the great object of maintaining a Squadron in the Mediterranean, which is the protection of our commerce, will be to keep the enemy in Port by blockading the places out of which they issue. Convoy must be given to our vessels as far as it can be done consistently with this object. - Whenever it is convenient to convoy, it will be proper that as many vessels as possible be collected, & not by affording convoy to the smaller part of our Commerce, expose the greater part to capture" (BW2:61, 18 February 1802)
- Still unable to give clear instructions about where the squadron should be: "I shall not point out to you the ground you are to occupy in the execution of these instructions. Circumstances may arise to induce a frequent change in your position and we have a perfect confidence that you will provide judiciously against every movement of the enemy. It is presumed that you will be enabled with the force thus committed to your direction, to afford the most complete protection to our commerce. Our Merchants will look to your vigilance and ability, for the protection of their property and adventure it with the utmost confidence of security" (SecNav to [Richard Valentine Morris](), 1 April 1802. BW2:100)

# Blockade
- [Legal definition of blockade]()
- [William Eaton]() declares a blockade on 23 July 1801 (BW1:528)
- [Richard Dale]() argues for a close blockade: "Should the United States Determin to carry on the War against Tripoli it will be highly necessary to keep it closly Blockaded, not to suffer any kind of Vessels, of any Nation to go in or come out, to do this it will take Two Frigates and two Sloops of War , two to be of[f] the Harbour and two to cruise along the Coast, to the Eastwd and Westward they will be under the necessity of going Into port for water &c that must be done by turns, also I think it would be advisable to have a small Vessel constructed to carry a Bomb to heave a few shells In the Town now & then" (BW1:553)
- Important to note that for the first year of the blockade, it was a joint operation with Sweden, who was doing the heavy lifting
    - [Alexander Murray]() notes the three Swedish frigates off Tripoli at a time when there are no(?) American ships, BW2:163, 1 June 1802

## Effectiveness
- Blockades were seasonal. [Weather]() made a big difference in how ships operated.
- [William Eaton]() writes, 24 July 1801, that Tripolitan government is concerned by the blockade because they don't have much food and get most of their food stores from Tunis (BW1:529)
    - Tunis also concerned because they don't want the blockade of Tripoli to harm them
- Eaton warns Dale that the Tripolitan admiral and his crews are trying to run the blockade by going home from Gibraltar in a Greek ship they have chartered for the purpose (BW1:566)
- Dale tells Eaton that it's vital that the Tunisians think there is still a ship off Tripoli, even though there is not in fact a ship there (BW1:571)
- Intelligence between ports on how the Tripolitans are trying to thwart the blockade is surprisingly good (see [James Leander Cathcart]()'s circular about the ambassador to Morocco's attempts to smuggle wheat into Tripoli, 11 September 1801, BW1:573-74)
- [Richard O'Brien](), worried that the Tripolitan crews blockaded in Gibraltar would figure out that there was no one actually blockading them in, and would get out via Oran to become "an Enemy in the rear" of the two frigates nearer Tripoli, leaked a false story that 4 more frigates were expected off Gibraltar any day and would be patrolling off Tripoli. He says that the strategy worked, and that the crews left Oran without a vessel. (BW1:616, 8 November 1801)
- [Richard Dale]() writes to [Thomas Appleton]() to warn imperial, Greek, and Ragusan ships that they have been notified that Tripoli is under blockade and ships continuing to trade with Tripoli will be subject to capture, as fits within the [Law of Nations]() (BW1:625, 24 November 1801)
- [William Eaton]() feels quite sanguine about how the blockade is going: " I confirm that Muley Soliman has agreed to allow Wheat, to be sent from his Court to Tripoly, but I should think it will be next to an impossibiiy for them to find Vessels to Charter for that Voyage, whilst that Port is so notoriously known to be blockaded" (BW2:91, 19 March 1802)
- [Andrew Morris](), captured captain of the brig *Franklin*, disagrees with the assessment that the blockade is effective: " It was the assurances I had from all quarters of the impossibility of their Cruizer to evade the vigilance o 9 the Blockade that led me to sea without convoy or Arms - fatal experience has convinced me to the contrary, for their small Vessels can go out any night in the week that they please and penetrate as far to the westward as Malaga, which .is manifest on a late occasion except a different plan is adopted by our fleet" (22 July 1802, BW2:177)
    - Morris outlines how the Tripolitan cruisers are able to get out
    - He offers this as an alternate plan: "Two Ships employed in the blockade here to keep up appearances, for it is no more, understand me - I mean a close Blockade without any indulgences, not at 6, & 8 leagues distance and oftentimes out of sight for days; all the rest of our force should be employed in cruising between Susa, Cape Bon, and Sicily; one Summer spent with vigilance in this manner I am certain would convince the Bashaw that America was in earnest procure me my liberty and an honorable peace for my country" (BW2:177)
- [Alexander Murray]() too sees the blockade as ineffective: "Altho we keep up the Blockade with all our diligence, & am myself seldom out of sight of the Town, the other Ships stationed in a Line along the Coast, yet they do contrive to get their small row Galleys out, in the night, in defiance of us, by rowing close under the land, & taking shelter occasionally in the small Ports, with which this coast abounds, for our parts, we dare not venture too close in, on account of sudden Calms, & no Anchorage till you are nearly on the Beach" (BW2:192-93, 8 July 1802)
