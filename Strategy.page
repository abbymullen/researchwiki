- BW1:429: [Samuel Smith]() to [Thomas Truxtun](), 10 April 1801: "The Object of the squadron are instructions to our young Officers or to carry into Execution the Law fixing the Peace Establishment of the U. S. It is Concieved also that such a squadron Cruizing in view of the Barbary Powers will have a tendency to revent them from seizing on our commerce, whenever Passion or a desire of Plunder might Incite them thereto."

# Purpose of cruises
## [Cruise 1 (Richard Dale)]()
In the orders of this cruise, it seems pretty clear that the government feels it likely that the temporary declaration of war with Tripoli will be revoked by the time the squadron gets there; hence the couching of the orders mostly in terms of instruction and encouragement--the president and secretary of the navy genuinely think a blockade will not be necessary. (See BW1:471, Secretary of State to [Rufus King](), 21 May 1801)

This feeling of pointlessness was shared by the crew as well, e.g., [William Turner](), surgeon for the *Philadelphia*: "I Presume we shall Have very little to do & what I learn of the Disposion of the Commodore He will Indulge the different Ships, under His Command with the Gratification of visiting most of the Ports in the Levant Smyrna Constantinople, Egypt &c - The French Ports Particularly" (BW1:480).

Dale wanted to keep a ship off Tripoli at all times (see BW1:521), but this desire proved impossible to fulfill.

By the end of the first cruise, Dale had a different perspective: "It is very pleasing to me, that you should think, that the Squadron under my command has been so arranged, and conducted, as to have baffled the Intentions, of thc Bey of Tripoli and his Admiral, It has been my pride, from the first of my arrival in those Seas, as well as the Commanders that I have had the Honor to Command, to Empress on the minds of those people, also, the European Nations, what the Government of the United States can do - and will do, I hope, when drove to act in a hostile manner" (BW1:611, letter to [David Humphreys](), 28 October 1801). 

## Cruise 2: 1802
- Secretary of the navy solidifies the blockade strategy: "The most effectual plan for accomplishing the great object of maintaining a Squadron in the Mediterranean, which is the protection of our commerce, will be to keep the enemy in Port by blockading the places out of which they issue. Convoy must be given to our vessels as far as it can be done consistently with this object. - Whenever it is convenient to convoy, it will be proper that as many vessels as possible be collected, & not by affording convoy to the smaller part of our Commerce, expose the greater part to capture" (BW2:61, 18 February 1802)
- Still unable to give clear instructions about where the squadron should be: "I shall not point out to you the ground you are to occupy in the execution of these instructions. Circumstances may arise to induce a frequent change in your position and we have a perfect confidence that you will provide judiciously against every movement of the enemy. It is presumed that you will be enabled with the force thus committed to your direction, to afford the most complete protection to our commerce. Our Merchants will look to your vigilance and ability, for the protection of their property and adventure it with the utmost confidence of security" (SecNav to [Richard Valentine Morris](), 1 April 1802. BW2:100)
- Continuingly vague instructions: "Considering the varying aspects of our affairs in the Mediterranean it would at this distance be hghly improper to lay you under absolute orders as to the precise disposition of your Squadron. You will therefore distribute them in such manner ss in your judgment will most effectually afford to our Commerce the proposed protection. But it will I trust, be in your power to emplo one of the frigates constantly in convoying our Merchantmen from Cadiz and another in convoying them from Malaga. And as Convoyed Vessels are liable to be dispersed in the Gut during Calms, the Enterprize might there meet each convoy for the purpose of keeping the Emperor's Boats in check." (SecNav to [Richard Valentine Morris](), 27 August 1802, BW2:258) See [Convoy](), [Communications]()
- BW2:291: [James Leander Cathcart]() and [Richard Valentine Morris]() agree that it's more important to keep a presence off Morocco than to continue to enforce the blockade until May or June of the next year, given the unrest with the Moroccans (12 October 1802)


# Blockade
- [Legal definition of blockade]()
- [William Eaton]() declares a blockade on 23 July 1801 (BW1:528)
- [Richard Dale]() argues for a close blockade: "Should the United States Determin to carry on the War against Tripoli it will be highly necessary to keep it closly Blockaded, not to suffer any kind of Vessels, of any Nation to go in or come out, to do this it will take Two Frigates and two Sloops of War , two to be of[f] the Harbour and two to cruise along the Coast, to the Eastwd and Westward they will be under the necessity of going Into port for water &c that must be done by turns, also I think it would be advisable to have a small Vessel constructed to carry a Bomb to heave a few shells In the Town now & then" (BW1:553)
- Important to note that for the first year of the blockade, it was a joint operation with Sweden, who was doing the heavy lifting
    - [Alexander Murray]() notes the three Swedish frigates off Tripoli at a time when there are no(?) American ships, BW2:163, 1 June 1802
    - 18 September 1802: As Murray is leaving the blockade, he communicates with the Swedish admiral, who plans to stay on station until 15 October and then leave until May; in the interim, providing [Convoy]() service to American and Swedish vessels (BW2:278)
