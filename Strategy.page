- BW1:429: [Samuel Smith]() to [Thomas Truxtun](), 10 April 1801: "The Object of the squadron are
instructions to our young Officers or to carry into Execution the Law fixing the Peace Establishment of the U. S. It is Concieved also that such a squadron Cruizing in view of the Barbary Powers will have a tendency to revent them from seizing on our commerce, whenever Passion or a desire of Plunder might Incite them thereto."

## Stores
- One of the key elements of the blockade is having enough supplies; where do these supplies come from?

# Purpose of cruises
## Cruise 1 ([Richard Dale]())
In the orders of this cruise, it seems pretty clear that the government feels it likely that the temporary declaration of war with Tripoli will be revoked by the time the squadron gets there; hence the couching of the orders mostly in terms of instruction and encouragement--the president and secretary of the navy genuinely think a blockade will not be necessary. (See BW1:471, Secretary of State to [Rufus King](), 21 May 1801)
