- BW1:429: [Samuel Smith]() to [Thomas Truxtun](), 10 April 1801: "The Object of the squadron are instructions to our young Officers or to carry into Execution the Law fixing the Peace Establishment of the U. S. It is Concieved also that such a squadron Cruizing in view of the Barbary Powers will have a tendency to revent them from seizing on our commerce, whenever Passion or a desire of Plunder might Incite them thereto."

## Stores
- One of the key elements of the blockade is having enough supplies; where do these supplies come from?

# Purpose of cruises
## Cruise 1 ([Richard Dale]())
In the orders of this cruise, it seems pretty clear that the government feels it likely that the temporary declaration of war with Tripoli will be revoked by the time the squadron gets there; hence the couching of the orders mostly in terms of instruction and encouragement--the president and secretary of the navy genuinely think a blockade will not be necessary. (See BW1:471, Secretary of State to [Rufus King](), 21 May 1801)

This feeling of pointlessness was shared by the crew as well, e.g., [William Turner](), surgeon for the *Philadelphia*: "I Presume we shall Have very little to do & what I learn of the Disposion of the Commodore He will Indulge the different Ships, under His Command with the Gratification of visiting most of the Ports in the Levant Smyrna Constantinople, Egypt &c - The French Ports Particularly" (BW1:480).

Dale wanted to keep a ship off Tripoli at all times (see BW1:521), but this desire proved impossible to fulfill.

By the end of the first cruise, Dale had a different perspective: "It is very pleasing to me, that you should think, that the Squadron under my command has been so arranged, and conducted, as to have baffled the Intentions, of thc Bey of Tripoli and his Admiral, It has been my pride, from the first of my arrival in those Seas, as well as the Commanders that I have had the Honor to Command, to Empress on the minds of those people, also, the European Nations, what the Government of the United States can do - and will do, I hope, when drove to act in a hostile manner" (BW1:611, letter to [David Humphreys](), 28 October 1801). 

# Blockade
- [Legal definition of blockade]()
- [William Eaton]() declares a blockade on 23 July 1801 (BW1:528)
- [Richard Dale]() argues for a close blockade: "Should the United States Determin to carry on the War against Tripoli it will be highly necessary to keep it closly Blockaded, not to suffer any kind of Vessels, of any Nation to go in or come out, to do this it will take Two Frigates and two Sloops of War , two to be of[f] the Harbour and two to cruise along the Coast, to the Eastwd and Westward they will be under the necessity of going Into port for water &c that must be done by turns, also I think it would be advisable to have a small Vessel constructed to carry a Bomb to heave a few shells In the Town now & then" (BW1:553)

## Effectiveness
- [William Eaton]() writes, 24 July 1801, that Tripolitan government is concerned by the blockade because they don't have much food and get most of their food stores from Tunis (BW1:529)
    - Tunis also concerned because they don't want the blockade of Tripoli to harm them
- Eaton warns Dale that the Tripolitan admiral and his crews are trying to run the blockade by going home from Gibraltar in a Greek ship they have chartered for the purpose (BW1:566)
- Dale tells Eaton that it's vital that the Tunisians think there is still a ship off Tripoli, even though there is not in fact a ship there (BW1:571)
- Intelligence between ports on how the Tripolitans are trying to thwart the blockade is surprisingly good (see [James Leander Cathcart]()'s circular about the ambassador to Morocco's attempts to smuggle wheat into Tripoli, 11 September 1801, BW1:573-74)
- [Richard O'Brien](), worried that the Tripolitan crews blockaded in Gibraltar would figure out that there was no one actually blockading them in, and would get out via Oran to become "an Enemy in the rear" of the two frigates nearer Tripoli, leaked a false story that 4 more frigates were expected off Gibraltar any day and would be patrolling off Tripoli. He says that the strategy worked, and that the crews left Oran without a vessel. (BW1:616, 8 November 1801)
- [Richard Dale]() writes to [Thomas Appleton]() to warn imperial, Greek, and Ragusan ships that they have been notified that Tripoli is under blockade and ships continuing to trade with Tripoli will be subject to capture, as fits within the [Law of Nations]() (BW1:625, 24 November 1801)

# Coup in Tripoli
-  [William Eaton]() first proposes a scheme to get [Yusuf Karamanli]() on board an American vessel to capture him? (BW1:567)
- First mention of [William Eaton]()'s plan to overthrow [Yusuf Karamanli](), 5 September 1801 (BW1:569)
