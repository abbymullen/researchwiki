- BW1:536: [William Bainbridge]() thinks warships should not be under the same constraints re: pratique as merchant ships (presumably because diseases aren't lurking in the cargo?), 30 July 1801
    - Response to Bainbridge's query: quarantine would be at least 15 days in Marseilles
    - Bainbridge's response: left Marseilles for a friendlier? port

- BW1:541: [William Kirkpatrick](), consul at Malaga: "The quarantine still continues to be inforced on all Vessels from the United States, notwithstanding the repeated representations of our Minister at Madrid for the orders regarding it to be repealed, or at least modified, This disagreeable circumstance must materially reduce the Trade which was carried on direct between the United States, & this Country, & particularly as it is only certain articles that are permitted to be landed whilst the quarantine lasts, & that not at every Port."

- BW1:628: [Richard Dale]() writes to the Commandant of Marine at [Toulon]() that his ship has only the normal non-contagious diseases on board, and "No gratifica- tion that I could receive by going on shore, would Induce me to request it, if I had the least suspision that the Inhabitance of this place would receive any Injury by it, I have now been better than five months in those seas and have not been five days on shore, put it all togeathor, therefore Sir, I hope you will take into consideration what I have said, and give permission for me to have prattique." (7 December 1801)

- BW2:267: [Alexander Murray]() and the [USS *Constellation*]() do not go on board any ships or allow anyone to board them in Tunis, lest they be quarantined at their next port (6 September 1802)
    - Their strategy pays off: at Palermo on 10 September, they get immediate pratique (BW2:271)
